260,91,2008-08-01T23:22:08Z,NA,49,Adding scripting functionality to .NET applications,"<p>I have a little game written in C#. It uses a database as back-end. It's 
a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectible_card_game"">trading card game</a>, and I wanted to implement the function of the cards as a script.</p>

<p>What I mean is that I essentially have an interface, <code>ICard</code>, which a card class implements (<code>public class Card056 : ICard</code>) and which contains function that are called by the game.</p>

<p>Now, to make the thing maintainable/moddable, I would like to have the class for each card as source code in the database and essentially compile it on first use. So when I have to add/change a card, I'll just add it to the database and tell my application to refresh, without needing any assembly deployment (especially since we would be talking about 1 assembly per card which means hundreds of assemblies).</p>

<p>Is that possible? Register a class from a source file and then instantiate it, etc.</p>

<pre><code>ICard Cards[current] = new MyGame.CardLibrary.Card056();
Cards[current].OnEnterPlay(ref currentGameState);

<p>The language is C#, but extra bonus if it's possible to write the script in any .NET language.</p>

I have one main class which acts like the public interface, with methods like <code>play()</code>, <code>stop()</code>, <code>pause()</code>, <code>record()</code> etc...

<p>I just learned about the existence of nested classes in C++, and I'm curious to know what programmers think about using them. I am a little wary and not really sure what the benefits/drawbacks are, but they seem (according to the book I'm reading) to be used in cases such as mine.</p>

<p>The book suggests that in a scenario like mine, a good solution would be to nest the workhorse classes inside the interface class, so there are no separate files for classes the client is not meant to use, and to avoid any possible naming conflicts? I don't know about these justifications. Nested classes are a new concept to me. Just want to see what programmers think about the issue.</p>

580,91,2008-08-02T23:30:59Z,NA,21,Deploying SQL Server Databases from Test to Live,"<p>I wonder how you guys manage deployment of a database between 2 SQL Servers, specifically SQL Server 2005.
Now, there is a development and a live one. As this should be part of a buildscript (standard windows batch, even do with current complexity of those scripts, i might switch to PowerShell or so later), Enterprise Manager/Management Studio Express do not count.</p>

<p>Would you just copy the .mdf File and attach it? I am always a bit careful when working with binary data, as this seems to be a compatiblity issue (even though development and live should run the same version of the server at all time).</p>

<p>Or - given the lack of ""EXPLAIN CREATE TABLE"" in T-SQL - do you do something that exports an existing database into SQL-Scripts which you can run on the target server? If yes, is there a tool that can automatically dump a given Database into SQL Queries and that runs off the command line? (Again, Enterprise Manager/Management Studio Express do not count).</p>

<p>And lastly - given the fact that the live database already contains data, the deployment may not involve creating all tables but rather checking the difference in structure and ALTER TABLE the live ones instead, which may also need data verification/conversion when existing fields change.</p>

<p>Now, i hear a lot of great stuff about the <a href=""http://www.red-gate.com/products/index.htm"">Red Gate</a> products, but for hobby projects, the price is a bit steep.</p>

The problem we have at the moment is that we need to write registry entries to <code>HKCU</code> for every user on the computer. They need to be in the <code>HKCU</code> rather than <code>HKLM</code> because they are the default user settings, and they do change per user. My feeling is that</p>

I don't really know anything about the Users root key, and haven't seen User/Machine Hive. Can anyone enlighten me on what they are? Perhaps they could solve my problem above.</p>

3260,186,2008-08-06T10:23:18Z,NA,46,Peak detection of measured signal,"<p>We use a data acquisition card to take readings from a device that increases its signal to a peak and then falls back to near the original value. To find the peak value we currently search the array for the highest reading and use the index to determine the timing of the peak value which is used in our calculations.</p>

<p>This works well if the highest value is the peak we are looking for but if the device is not working correctly we can see a second peak which can be higher than the initial peak. We take 10 readings a second from 16 devices over a 90 second period.</p>

<p>My initial thoughts are to cycle through the readings checking to see if the previous and next points are less than the current to find a peak and construct an array of peaks. Maybe we should be looking at a average of a number of points either side of the current position to allow for noise in the system. Is this the best way to proceed or are there better techniques?</p>

I'm considering using a <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/sqlclr/archive/2005/06/29/regex.aspx"">CLR function to add regex matching</a>, but I'm curious to see what other solutions people might have.</p>

<p>Thus, my need for a workaround.  I'm only using search in my site on an actual search page - so it needs to work basically the same way that Google works (in the eyes on a Joe Sixpack-type user). Not nearly as complicated, but this sort of match really shouldn't fail.</p>

<p>EDIT:
The goal is find the date and time that you get as a result of adding several hours to the current time. This is used to determine a default value for a due date of a submission. I want to add 3 hours to the current time to get the due date time. However, I don't want due dates that go beyond 5pm on the current day. So, I tried to have the hours split between (today, up to 5pm) and (tomorrow, from 8am on), such that adding 3 hours to 4pm would give you 19am, because 1 hour is added to the end of today and 2 hours are added to the beginning of tomorrow.</p>

I pointed them to Telligent's Community Server and  we had a sales like meeting today to get the Marketing folks on board. 
My question is if anyone has had issues working with Community Server, skinning it and extending it?<br>
I wanted to explain a bit why I am thinking Community Server, the company is wanting multiple blogs with multiple authors.  I want to be out of the admin part of this as much as possible and didn't think there were too many engines that having multiple blogs didn't mean db work.  I also like the other functionality that Community Server provides and think the company will find it useful, particularly the media section as right now we have some really shotty way of dealing with whitepapers and stuff.</p>

<p>edit: We are actually using the Sitecore blog module for a single blog on our intranet (which is actually what the CMS is serving).  Some reasoning for why I don't like it for our public site are they are on different servers, it doesn't support multiple authors, there is no built in syndication, it is a little flimsy feeling to me from looking at the source and I personally think the other features of Community Server make its price tag worth it.</p>

<p>another edit: Need to stick to .net software that run on sql server in my company's case, but I don't mind seeing recommendations for others.  ExpressionEngine looks promising, will try it out on my personal box.</p>"
5600,615,2008-08-08T02:47:15Z,NA,37,Tables with no Primary Key,"<p>I have several tables whose only unique data is a uniqueidentifier (a Guid) column. Because guids are non-sequential (and they're client-side generated so I can't use newsequentialid()), I have made a non-primary, non-clustered index on this ID field rather than giving the tables a clustered primary key.</p>

<p>I'm wondering what the performance implications are for this approach. I've seen some people suggest that tables should have an auto-incrementing (""identity"") int as a clustered primary key even if it doesn't have any meaning, as it means that the database engine itself can use that value to quickly look up a row instead of having to use a bookmark.</p>

<p>My database is merge-replicated across a bunch of servers, so I've shied away from identity int columns as they're a bit hairy to get right in replication.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts? Should tables have primary keys? Or is it ok to not have any clustered indexes if there are no sensible columns to index that way?</p>

9240,1144,2008-08-12T21:06:38Z,NA,10,Interfaces on different logic layers,"<p>Say you have an application divided into 3-tiers: GUI, business logic, and data access. In your business logic layer you have described your business objects: getters, setters, accessors, and so on... you get the idea. The interface to the business logic layer guarantees safe usage of the business logic, so all the methods and accessors you call will validate input. </p>

<p>This great when you first write the UI code, because you have a neatly defined interface that you can trust.</p>

<p>But here comes the tricky part, when you start writing the data access layer, the interface to the business logic does not accommodate your needs. You need to have more accessors and getters to set fields which are/used to be hidden. Now you are forced to erode the interface of your business logic; now it is possible set fields from the UI layer, which the UI layer has no business setting. </p>

<p>Because of the changes needed for the data access layer, the interface to the business logic has eroded to the point where it is possible to even set the business logic with invalid data. Thus, the interface does not guarantee safe usage anymore.</p>

<p>I hope I explained the problem clearly enough. How do you prevent interface eroding, maintain information hiding and encapsulation, and yet still accommodate different interface needs among different layers? </p>

<p>Currently, the clients remoting call RemotingService and blocks while the RemotingService call is serviced. However, the remoting service is getting complicated enough (with more RPC calls and complex algorithms) that the asp.net worker threads are blocked for a significantly long time (4-5 seconds).</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc164128.aspx"">this msdn article</a>, doing this will not scale well because an asp.net worker thread is blocked for each remoting RPC. It advises switching to async handlers to free up asp.net worker threads.</p>

  <p>The purpose of an asynchronous handler
  is to free up an ASP.NET thread pool
  thread to service additional requests

  original request.</p>

10860,377,2008-08-14T10:23:05Z,NA,8,Data Layer Best Practices,"<p>I am in the middle of a ""discussion"" with a colleague about the best way to implement the data layer in a new application.</p>

<p>One viewpoint is that the data layer should be aware of business objects (our own classes that represent an entity), and be able to work with that object natively.  </p>

<p>The opposing viewpoint is that the data layer should be object-agnostic, and purely handle simple data types (strings, bools, dates, etc.)</p>

<p>I can see that both approaches may be valid, but my own viewpoint is that I prefer the former.  That way, if the data storage medium changes, the business layer doesn't (necessarily) have to change to accommodate the new data layer.  It would therefore be a trivial thing to change from a SQL data store to a serialized xml filesystem store.</p>

<p>My colleague's point of view is that the data layer shouldn't have to know about object definitions, and that as long as the data is passed about appropriately, that is enough.  </p>

<p>Now, I know that this is one of those questions that has the potential to start a religious war, but I'd appreciate any feedback from the community on how you approach such things.  </p>

Say that I have a view which can accept drag and drop, but only in certain areas. Once the user drags over one of these areas I call <code>DragManager.acceptDrag(this)</code> (from a <code>DragEvent.DRAG_OVER</code> handler), but if the user then moves out of this area I'd like to change the status of the drag to not accepted and show the <code>DragManager.NONE</code> feedback. However, neither calling <code>DragManager.acceptDrag(null)</code> nor <code>DragManager.showFeedback(DragManager.NONE)</code> seems to have any effect. Once I've accepted the drag an set the feedback type I can't seem to change it.</p>

<p>Just to make it clear: the areas where the user should be able to drop are not components or even display objects, in fact they are just ranges in the text of a text field (like the selection). Had they been components of their own I could have solved it by making each of them accept drag events individually. I guess I could create proxy components that float over the text to emulate it, but I'd rather not if it isn't necessary.</p>

<hr>

<p>I've managed to get it working in both AIR and the browser now, but only by putting proxy components on top of the ranges of text where you should be able to drop things. That way I get the right feedback and drops are automatically unaccepted on drag exit.</p>

<p>This is the oddest thing about D&amp;D in AIR:</p>

<pre><code>DragManager.doDrag(initiator, source, event, dragImage, offsetX, offsetY);
</code></pre>

<p>In browser-based Flex, <code>offsetX</code> and <code>offsetY</code> should be negative (so says the documentation, and it works fine). However, when running <em>exactly the same code</em> in AIR you have to make the offsets positive. The same numbers, but positive. That is very, very weird.</p>

<p>I've tested some more and what <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10870/how-can-i-unaccept-a-drag-in-flex#11209"">@maclema</a> works, but not if you run in AIR. It seems like drag and drop in AIR is different. It's really, really weird because not only is the feedback not showing correctly, and it's not possible to unaccept, but the coordinates are also completely off. I just tried my application in a browser instead of AIR and dragging and dropping is completely broken.</p>

<p>Also, skipping the <code>dragEnter</code> handler works fine in AIR, but breaks everything when running in a browser.</p>

11720,1341,2008-08-14T21:32:34Z,NA,15,How can I create virtual machines as part of a build process using MSBuild and MS Virtual Server and/or Hyper-V Server Virtualization?,"<p>What I would like to do is create a clean virtual machine image as the output of a build of an application.</p>

<p>So a new virtual machine would be created (from a template is fine, with the OS installed, and some base software installed) --- a new web site would be created in IIS, and the web app build output copied to a location on the virtual machine hard disk, and IIS configured correctly, the VM would start up and run.</p>

<p>I know there are MSBuild tasks to script all the administrative actions in IIS, but how do you script all the actions with Virtual machines?  Specifically, creating a new virtual machine from a template, naming it uniquely, starting it, configuring it, etc...</p>

<p>Specifically I was wondering if anyone has successfully implemented any VM scripting as part of a build process.</p>

<p>Update: I assume with Hyper-V, there is a different set of libraries/APIs to script virtual machines, anyone played around with this?  And anyone with real practical experience of doing something like this?</p>

11740,1336,2008-08-14T22:32:58Z,NA,4,Configurable Table Prefixes with a .Net OR/M?,"<p>In a web application like wiki or forums or blogging software, it is often useful to store your data in a relational database. Since many hosting companies offer a single database with their hosting plans (with additional databases costing extra) it is very useful for your users when your database objects (tables, views, constraints, and stored procedures) have a common prefix. It is typical for applications aware of database scarcity to have a hard-coded table prefix. I want more, however. Specifically, I'd like to have a table prefix that users can designate&mdash;say in the web.config file (with an appropriate default, of course).</p>

<p>Since I hate coding <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create%2C_read%2C_update_and_delete"" rel=""nofollow"">CRUD</a> operations by hand, I prefer to work through a competent OR/M and have used (and enjoyed) LINQ to SQL, Subsonic, and ADO.Net. I'm having some thrash in a new project, however, when it comes to putting a table prefix in a user's web.config file. Are there any .Net-based OR/M products that can handle this scenario elegantly?</p>

<p>The best I have been able to come up with so far is using LINQ to SQL with an external mapping file that I'd have to update somehow based on an as-yet hypothetical web.config setting.</p>

<p>Anyone have a better solution? I tried to make it happen in Entity Framework, but that turned into a mess quickly. (Due to my unfamiliarity with EF? Possibly.) How about SubSonic? Does it have an option to apply a table prefix besides at code generation time?</p>

How much larger does the file appear as it is being sent due to the XML data and character encoding? Is compression built into web services?</p>

12140,1037,2008-08-15T11:12:35Z,NA,2,Access to global application settings,"<p>A database application that I'm currently working on, stores all sorts of settings in the database. Most of those settings are there to customize certain business rules, but there's also some other stuff in there.</p>

<p>The app contains objects that specifically do a certain task, e.g., a certain complicated calculation. Those non-UI objects are unit-tested, but also need access to lots of those global settings. The way we've implemented this right now, is by giving the objects properties that are filled by the Application Controller at runtime. When testing, we create the objects in the test and fill in values for testing (not from the database).</p>

<p>This works better, in any case much better than having all those objects need some global <em>Settings</em> object --- that of course effectively makes unit testing impossible :) Disadvantage can be that you sometimes need to set a dozen of properties, or that you need to let those properties 'percolate' into sub-objects.</p>

<p><strong>So the general question is</strong>: how do you provide access to global application settings in your projects, without the need for global variables, while still being able to unit test your code? This must be a problem that's been solved 100's of times...</p>

<p>(Note: I'm not too much of an experienced programmer, as you'll have noticed; but I love to learn! And of course, I've already done research into this topic, but I'm really looking for some first-hand experiences)</p>

<p>I'm writing a small display to show customers what days they can water their lawns based on their watering group (ABCDE) and what time of year it is.  Our seasons look like this:
Summer (5-1 to 8-31) 
Spring  (3-1 to 4-30) 
Fall (9-1 to 10-31)
Winter (11-1 to 2-28) </p>

<p>An example might be:</p>

<p>If I'm in group A, here would be my allowed times:
Winter: Mondays only
Spring: Tues, Thurs, Sat
Summer: Any Day
Fall: Tues, Thurs, Sat</p>

<p>If I was writing this in PHP I would use arrays like this:</p>

<pre><code>//M=Monday,t=Tuesday,T=Thursday.... etc
$schedule[""A""][""Winter""]='M';
$schedule[""A""][""Spring""]='tTS';
$schedule[""A""][""Summer""]='Any';
$schedule[""A""][""Fall""]='tTS';
$schedule[""B""][""Winter""]='t';
</code></pre>

<p>I COULD make the days arrays (array(""Tuesday"",""Thursday"",""Saturday"")) etc, but it is not necessary for what I'm really trying to accomplish.</p>

<p>I will also need to setup arrays to determine what season I'm in:</p>

<pre><code>$seasons[""Summer""][""start""]=0501;
$seasons[""Summer""][""end""]=0801;
</code></pre>

<p>Can anyone suggest a really cool way to do this? I will have today's date and the group letter.  I will need to get out of my function a day (M) or a series of days (tTS), (Any).</p>

<p>In some way a felt uncomfortable, cause, there is no code and everything I was used to, but in the other hand I could speed up my developing. The fact is that eventually I returned to use C# because I find it more flexible to develop, I can make unit testing, use CVS, I have access to more resources and basically I had ""all the control"". I felt that this tool didn't give me confidence and I thought that later in the project I could not manage it due to its forced established rules of development. And also a lot of things like sending emails, using my own controls, and other things had their complication, it seemed that at some point it was not going to be as easy as initially I thought and as initially the product claims.

<p>So, the question is this: For simple data retrievals, which approach is better, LINQ-to-SQL or stored procs? Any specific pro's or con's?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

15310,1644,2008-08-18T22:19:16Z,NA,3,Optimizing the PDF Export of Huge Reports in Sql Reporting Services 2005,"<p>First off I understand that it is a horrible idea to run extremely large/long running reports. I am aware that Microsoft has a rule of thumb stating that a SSRS report should take no longer than 30 seconds to execute.  However sometimes gargantuan reports are a preferred evil due to external forces such complying with state laws.</p>

<p>At my place of employment, we have an asp.net (2.0) app that we have migrated from Crystal Reports to SSRS. Due to the large user base and complex reporting UI requirements we have a set of screens that accepts user inputted parameters and creates schedules to be run over night. Since the application supports multiple reporting frameworks we do not use the scheduling/snapshot facilities of SSRS. All of the reports in the system are generated by a scheduled console app which takes user entered parameters and generates the reports with the corresponding reporting solutions the reports were created with. In the case of SSRS reports, the console app generates the SSRS reports and exports them as PDFs via the SSRS web service API. </p>

<p>So far SSRS has been much easier to deal with than Crystal with the exception of a certain 25,000 page report that we have recently converted from crystal reports to SSRS. The SSRS server is a 64bit 2003 server with 32 gigs of ram running SSRS 2005. All of our smaller reports work fantastically, but we are having trouble with our larger reports such as this one.  Unfortunately, we can't seem to generate the aforemention report through the web service API. The following error occurs roughly 30-35 minutes into the generation/export:</p>

<p>Exception Message: The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a receive.</p>

<p>The web service call is something I'm sure you all have seen before:  </p>

<pre><code>data = rs.Render(this.ReportPath, this.ExportFormat, null, deviceInfo,
   selectedParameters, null, null, out encoding, out mimeType, out usedParameters, 
   out warnings, out streamIds);
</code></pre>

<p>The odd thing is that this report will run/render/export if the report is run directly on the reporting server using the report manager. The proc that produces the data for the report runs for about 5 minutes. The report renders in SSRS native format in the browser/viewer after about 12 minutes. Exporting to pdf through the browser/viewer in the report manager takes an additional 55 minutes. This works reliably and it produces a whopping 1.03gb pdf.</p>

<p>Here are some of the more obvious things I've tried to get the report working via the web service API:  </p>

<ul>
<li>set the HttpRuntime ExecutionTimeout
value to 3 hours on the report
server</li>
<li>disabled http keep alives on the report server</li>
<li>increased the script timeout on the report server</li>
<li>set the report to never time out on the server</li>
<li>set the report timeout to several hours on the client call  </li>
</ul>

<p>From the tweaks I have tried, I am fairly comfortable saying that any timeout issues have been eliminated. </p>

<p>Based off of my research of the error message, I believe that the web service API does not send chunked responses by default. This means that it tries to send all 1.3gb over the wire in one response. At a certain point, IIS throws in the towel. Unfortunately the API abstracts away web service configuration so I can't seem to find a way to enable response chunking. </p>

<ol>
<li>Does anyone know of anyway to reduce/optimize the PDF export phase and or the size of the PDF without lowering the total page count?</li>
<li>Is there a way to turn on response chunking for SSRS?</li>
<li>Does anyone else have any other theories as to why this runs on the server but not through the API?</li>
</ol>

<p>EDIT: After reading kcrumley's post I began to take a look at the average page size by taking file size / page count. Interestingly enough on smaller reports the math works out so that each page is roughly 5K. Interestingly, when the report gets larger this ""average"" increases. An 8000 page report for example is averaging over 40K/page. Very odd. I will also add that the number of records per page is set except for the last page in each grouping, so it's not a case where some pages have more records than another. </p>

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<hr>

<p>dp: You are right that I missed a check in Equals, I have updated it.  Using the existing hashcode from the byte array will result in reference equality (or at least that same concept translated to hashcodes).
for example:</p>

<pre><code>byte[] b1 = new byte[] { 1 };
byte[] b2 = new byte[] { 1 };
int h1 = b1.GetHashCode();
int h2 = b2.GetHashCode();
</code></pre>

<p>With that code, despite the two byte arrays having the same values within them, they are referring to different parts of memory and will result in (probably) different hash codes. I need the hash codes for two byte arrays with the same contents to be equal.</p>

17500,2074,2008-08-20T07:07:30Z,NA,19,Why are DispatcherObject.CheckAccess() and VerifyAccess() hidden from Intellisense?,"<p>The <code>System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherObject</code> class (which <code>DependencyObject</code> is based on) contains a useful function, called <code>CheckAccess()</code>, that determines whether or not the code is running on the UI thread.</p>

<p>When I wanted to use it yesterday, I was puzzled to find out that Intellisense didn't show the function (nor <code>VerifyAccess()</code>, which throws an exception when not on the UI thread), even though the MSDN library lists it. I decided to investigate the class using Reflector. It seems that the function in question has an <code>EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)</code> attribute attached to it. The <code>Dispatcher</code> class, which is used by <code>DispatcherObject</code>, has the same attribute attached to <code>CheckAccess()</code> and <code>VerifyAccess()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class DispatcherObject
{
    // ...

    [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]
    public bool CheckAccess();
    [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]
    public void VerifyAccess();

    // ...

    [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Advanced)]
    public Dispatcher Dispatcher { get; }
}


public sealed class Dispatcher
{
    // ...

    [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]
    public bool CheckAccess();
    [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]
    public void VerifyAccess();

    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>I don't believe that the application of that attribute is random (or a joke), so my question is: why is it there? Should those methods not be called directly? Then why aren't they <code>protected</code> (or <code>internal</code>, like some of the most useful methods in the WPF)?</p>

17670,379,2008-08-20T09:37:02Z,NA,1,Suitable alternative to CryptEncrypt,"<p>We have a situation in our product where for a long time some data has been stored in the application's database as SQL string (choice of MS SQL server or sybase SQL anywhere) which was encrypted via the Windows API function <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa379924.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">CryptEncrypt.</a>  (direct and decryptable)</p>

<p>The problem is that CryptEncrypt can produce NULL's in the output, meaning that when it's stored in the database, the string manipulations will at some point truncate the ciphertext.</p>

<p>Ideally we'd like to use an algo that will produce cyphertext that doesn't contain NULLs as that will cause the least amount of change to the existing databases (changing a column from string to binary and code to deal with binary instead of strings) and just decrypt existing data and re-encrypt with the new algo at database upgrade time.</p>

<p>The algorithm doesn't need to be the most secure, as the database is already in a reasonably secure environment (not an open network / teh interwebs) but does need to bebetter than ROT13 (which I can almost decrypt in my head now!)</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<p>edit: btw, any particular reason for changing ciphertext to cyphertext? ciphertext seems more widely used...</p>

While there are some AppleScript hooks, it looks like the best approach is to manipulate the underlying XML data.</p>

<p>This turns out to be pretty ugly because (for example) page breaks are stored in XML. So for example, you have something like:</p>

<pre><code>... we hold these truths to be self evident, that &lt;/page&gt;
&lt;page&gt;all men are created equal, and are ...

<p>So if you want to add or remove text, you have to move the start/end tags around based on the size of the text on the page. This is pretty impossible without computing the number of words a page can hold, which seems wildly inelegant.</p>

<p>Currently: I have three arrays of regex, one for valid filenames, one for files missing an episode name, and one for valid paths.</p>

<p>Then, I loop though each valid-filename regex, if it matches, append it to a ""valid"" dict, if not, do the same with the missing-ep-name regexs, if it matches this I append it to an ""invalid"" dict with an error code (2:'missing epsiode name'), if it matches neither, it gets added to invalid with the 'malformed name' error code.</p>

<p>The current code can be found <a href=""http://github.com/dbr/checktveps/tree/8a6dc68ad61e684c8d8f0ca1dc37a22d1c51aa82/2checkTvEps.py"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a></p>

<p>The rules it needs to check would be..</p>

<ul>
<li>File is in the format <code>Show Name - [01x23] - Episode Name.avi</code> or <code>Show Name - [01xSpecial02] - Special Name.avi</code> or <code>Show Name - [01xExtra01] - Extra Name.avi</code></li>
<li>If filename is in the format <code>Show Name - [01x23].avi</code> display it a 'missing episode name' section of the output</li>
<li>The path should be in the format <code>Show Name/season 2/the_file.avi</code> (where season 2 should be the correct season number in the filename)</li>
<li>each <code>Show Name/season 1/</code> folder should contain ""folder.jpg""</li>

<p>Basically, I have an external disk with two volumes: </p>

<p>One is an HFS+ volume which I use for TimeMachine backups.
The other, an NTFS volume that I use for general file copying etc on Mac and Windows boxes.</p>

<p>So what happens is that whenever I plug in the disk into my Mac USB, OSX goes off and mounts both volumes and shows an icon on the desktop for each. The thing is that to remove the disk you have to eject the volume and in this case do it for both volumes, which causes an annoying warning dialog to be shown every time. </p>

<p>What I'd prefer is some way to prevent the NTFS volume from auto-mounting altogether. I've done some hefty googling and here's a list of things I've tried so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>I've tried going through options in Disk Utility</li>
<li>I've tried setting AutoMount to No in /etc/hostconfig but that is a bit too global for my liking.</li>
<li>I've also tried the suggested approach to putting settings in fstab but it appears the OSX (10.5) is ignoring these settings.</li>

<p>However I would be particularly interested to know if there is a performance impact when the memory to index size ration starts getting small (ie. the index size becomes much bigger than the available memory)? I've been told on the #postgresql IRC channel that GIN needs to keep all the index in memory, otherwise it won't be effective, because, unlike B-Tree, it doesn't know which part to read in from disk for a particular query? The question would be: is this true (because I've also been told the opposite of this)? Does GiST have the same restrictions? Are there other restrictions I should be aware of while using one of these indexing algorithms?</p>

<p>I need to use push-technology with WCF through client firewalls. This must be a common problem, and I know for a fact it works in theory (see links below), but I have failed to get it working, and I haven't been able to find a code sample that demonstrates it.</p>

<p>Requirements: </p>

<ul>
<li>WCF</li>
<li>Clients connects to server through tcp port 80 (netTcpBinding).</li>
<li>Server pushes back information at irregular intervals (1 min to several hours).</li>
<li>Users should not have to configure their firewalls, server pushes must pass through firewalls that have all inbound ports closed. TCP duplex on the same connection is needed for this, a dual binding does not work since a port has to be opened on the client firewall.</li>
<li>Clients sends heartbeats to server at regular intervals (perhaps every 15 mins) so server knows client is still alive.</li>
<li>Server is IIS7 with WAS.</li>
</ul>

<p>The solution seems to be duplex netTcpBinding. Based on this information:</p>

The syntax for parameter declarations was also changed to reflect the C++ style.</p>

22570,1219,2008-08-22T14:53:47Z,NA,9,What's a good way to check if two datetimes are on the same calendar day in TSQL?,"<p>Here is the issue I am having: I have a large query that needs to compare datetimes in the where clause to see if two dates are on the same day.  My current solution, which sucks, is to send the datetimes into a UDF to convert them to midnight of the same day, and then check those dates for equality.  When it comes to the query plan, this is a disaster, as are almost all UDFs in joins or where clauses.  This is one of the only places in my application that I haven't been able to root out the functions and give the query optimizer something it can actually use to locate the best index.</p>

<p>In this case, merging the function code back into the query seems impractical.</p>

<p>I think I am missing something simple here.</p>

<p>Here's the function for reference.</p>

<pre><code>if not exists (select * from dbo.sysobjects 
              where id = object_id(N'dbo.f_MakeDate') and               
              type in (N'FN', N'IF', N'TF', N'FS', N'FT'))
  exec('create function dbo.f_MakeDate() returns int as 
         begin declare @retval int return @retval end')
go

alter function dbo.f_MakeDate
(
    @Day datetime, 
    @Hour int, 
    @Minute int
)
returns datetime
as

/*

Creates a datetime using the year-month-day portion of @Day, and the 
@Hour and @Minute provided

*/

begin

declare @retval datetime
set @retval = cast(
    cast(datepart(m, @Day) as varchar(2)) + 
    '/' + 
    cast(datepart(d, @Day) as varchar(2)) + 
    '/' + 
    cast(datepart(yyyy, @Day) as varchar(4)) + 
    ' ' + 
    cast(@Hour as varchar(2)) + 
    ':' + 
    cast(@Minute as varchar(2)) as datetime)
return @retval
end

go
</code></pre>

<p>To complicate matters, I am joining on time zone tables to check the date against the local time, which could be different for every row:</p>

<pre><code>where 
dbo.f_MakeDate(dateadd(hh, tz.Offset + 
    case when ds.LocalTimeZone is not null 
    then 1 else 0 end, t.TheDateINeedToCheck), 0, 0) = @activityDateMidnight
</code></pre>

<p>[Edit]</p>

<p>I'm incorporating @Todd's suggestion:</p>

<pre><code>where datediff(day, dateadd(hh, tz.Offset + 
    case when ds.LocalTimeZone is not null 
    then 1 else 0 end, t.TheDateINeedToCheck), @ActivityDate) = 0
</code></pre>

<p>My misconception about how datediff works (the same day of year in consecutive years yields 366, not 0 as I expected) caused me to waste a lot of effort.</p>

<p>But the query plan didn't change.  I think I need to go back to the drawing board with the whole thing.</p>

bob.readings                      # =&gt; [&lt;Reading 1&gt;]

<p>But to no avail.  I always seem to get stuck on the simple view issues after everything's set.

It uses a copula, if any are familiar with that.  I need to sum up the values in the array based on which dimensions are ""cared about.""</p>

<pre>
Dimension 0 (across)
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
|_ 0 _|_ 0 _|_ 0 _|_ 2 _|  Dimension 1
|_ 1 _|_ 0 _|_ 2 _|_ 0 _|   (down)
|_ 0 _|_ 3 _|_ 0 _|_ 6 _|
|_ 0 _|_ 0 _|_ 0 _|_ 0 _|

I ""care about"" dimension 0 only, and ""don't care"" about the rest (dim 1).
Summing this array with the above specifications will
""collapse"" the ""stacks"" of dimension 1 down to a single 4 x 1 array:

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 
|_ 1 _|_ 3 _|_ 2 _|_ 8 _|

This can then be summed, or have any operation performed.

<p>I need to do this with an array of 'n' dimensions, which could feasibly be 20. Also, I need to be able to do this, caring about certain dimensions, and collapsing the rest.

Many of my posts regard implementing a genetic algorithm (This post, sparsearray, rank an array, pointer manipulation).</li>
<li>I am using a sparse array representation, as it is possible to exceed the number of molecules in the universe using a traditional (dense) array.  For now, the implementation of the sparsearray itself doesnt matter a whole lot, as I am working to make it work with a standard array before going to a sparse representation.  For those who havent seen my previous questions, I am using a binary search tree as the structure to contain the sparse array points, and a ""driver"" function to traverse the tree as necessary, returning whatever the function is designed to do.  This is flexible, so I can accomodate a lot of different methods of accessing the array. </li>
<li>The structure is a hypercube, and the number of dimensions is specified at run time, as well as the length of each dimension (which are all the same, as it is a hypercube).</li>

I'm currently doing the following and I'm not convinced it is the best method:</p>

<pre><code>BlockingQueue&lt;Violation&gt; vQueue;
/* 
in the constructor I pass in a BlockingQueue object 
full of violations that need to be processed - cut out for brevity

Violation v;
while ( ( v = vQueue.poll(500, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS) ) != null ) {
    // do stuff with the violation

23970,1190,2008-08-23T04:22:44Z,NA,16,How do I marshal a lambda (Proc) in Ruby?,"<p>Joe Van Dyk <a href=""http://www.zenspider.com/pipermail/ruby/2008-August/004223.html"">asked the Ruby mailing list</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi,</p>
  
  <p>In Ruby, I guess you can't marshal a lambda/proc object, right?  Is
  that possible in lisp or other languages?</p>
  
  <p>What I was trying to do:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>l = lamda { ... }
Bj.submit ""/path/to/ruby/program"", :stdin =&gt; Marshal.dump(l)
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, I'm sending BackgroundJob a lambda object, which contains the
  context/code for what to do.  But, guess that wasn't possible.  I
  ended up marshaling a normal ruby object that contained instructions
  for what to do after the program ran.</p>

<p>Assuming that somebody doesn't come out and show that classes are too slow, it looks like class wins.</p>

<p>I've not idea which answer I should accept to I've just upvoted all of them.</p>

<hr>

<p>And I have now written two near identical pages, one using the 2D array (written before this question was posted) and now one using a class and I must say that the class produces much nicer code. I have no idea how much overhead is going to be generated but I doubt it will rival the improvement to the code itself.</p>

24200,1948,2008-08-23T12:53:09Z,NA,50,What's the fastest way to bulk insert a lot of data in SQL Server (C# client),"<p>I am hitting some performance bottlenecks with my C# client inserting bulk data into a SQL Server 2005 database and I'm looking for ways in which to speed up the process.</p>

<p>I am already using the SqlClient.SqlBulkCopy (which is based on TDS) to speed up the data transfer across the wire which helped a lot, but I'm still looking for more.</p>

<p>I have a simple table that looks like this: </p>

<pre><code> CREATE TABLE [BulkData](
 [ContainerId] [int] NOT NULL,
 [BinId] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 [Sequence] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 [ItemId] [int] NOT NULL,
 [Left] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 [Top] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 [Right] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 [Bottom] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 CONSTRAINT [PKBulkData] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED 
 (
  [ContainerIdId] ASC,
  [BinId] ASC,
  [Sequence] ASC
))
</code></pre>

<p>I'm inserting data in chunks that average about 300 rows where ContainerId and BinId are constant in each chunk and the Sequence value is 0-n and the values are pre-sorted based on the primary key.  </p>

<p>The %Disk time performance counter spends a lot of time at 100% so it is clear that disk IO is the main issue but the speeds I'm getting are several orders of magnitude below a raw file copy.</p>

<p>Does it help any if I:</p>

<ol>
<li>Drop the Primary key while I am doing the inserting and recreate it later</li>
<li>Do inserts into a temporary table with the same schema and periodically transfer them into the main table to keep the size of the table where insertions are happening small</li>
<li>Anything else?</li>
</ol>

<p>--
Based on the responses I have gotten, let me clarify a little bit:</p>

<p>Portman: I'm using a clustered index because when the data is all imported I will need to access data sequentially in that order.  I don't particularly need the index to be there while importing the data.  Is there any advantage to having a nonclustered PK index while doing the inserts as opposed to dropping the constraint entirely for import?</p>

<p>Chopeen:  The data is being generated remotely on many other machines (my SQL server can only handle about 10 currently, but I would love to be able to add more).  It's not practical to run the entire process on the local machine because it would then have to process 50 times as much input data to generate the output.</p>

<p>Jason: I am not doing any concurrent queries against the table during the import process, I will try dropping the primary key and see if that helps.</p>

24270,2131,2008-08-23T14:40:28Z,NA,126,What's the point of OOP?,"<p>As far as I can tell, in spite of the countless millions or billions spent on OOP education, languages, and tools, OOP has not improved developer productivity or software reliability, nor has it reduced development costs. Few people use OOP in any rigorous sense (few people adhere to or understand principles such as LSP); there seems to be little uniformity or consistency to the approaches that people take to modelling problem domains.  All too often, the class is used simply for its syntactic sugar; it puts the functions for a record type into their own little namespace.</p>

<p>I've written a large amount of code for a wide variety of applications. Although there have been places where true substitutable subtyping played a valuable role in the application, these have been pretty exceptional. In general, though much lip service is given to talk of ""re-use"" the reality is that unless a piece of code does <em>exactly</em> what you want it to do, there's very little cost-effective ""re-use"".  It's extremely hard to design classes to be extensible <em>in the right way</em>, and so the cost of extension is normally so great that ""re-use"" simply isn't worthwhile.</p>

<p>In many regards, this doesn't surprise me.  The real world isn't ""OO"", and the idea implicit in OO--that we can model things with some class taxonomy--seems to me very fundamentally flawed (I can sit on a table, a tree stump, a car bonnet, someone's lap--but not one of those is-a chair).  Even if we move to more abstract domains, OO modelling is often difficult, counterintuitive, and ultimately unhelpful (consider the classic examples of circles/ellipses or squares/rectangles).</p>

<p>So what am I missing here? Where's the value of OOP, and why has all the time and money failed to make software any better?</p>

25550,2775,2008-08-25T01:49:22Z,NA,4,What's the best way to import/read data from pdf files?,"<p>We get a large amount of data from our clients in pdf files in varying formats [layout-wise], these files are typically report output, and are typically properly annotated [they don't usually need OCR], but not formatted well enough that simply copying several hundred pages of text out of acrobat is not going to work.</p>

<p>The best approach I've found so far is to write a script to parse the nearly-valid xml output (the comments are invalid and many characters are escaped in varying ways, é becomes [[[e9]]]é, $ becomes \$, % becomes \%...) of the command-line pdftoipe utility (to convert pdf files for a program called <a href=""http://tclab.kaist.ac.kr/ipe/"" rel=""nofollow"">ipe</a>), which gives me text elements with their positions on each page [see sample below], which works well enough for reports where the same values are on the same place on every page I care about, but would require extra scripting effort for importing matrix [cross-tab] pdf files. pdftoipe is not at all intended for this, and at best can be compiled manually using cygwin for windows.</p>

In there, a commenter said that honey pot form fields (form fields hidden with CSS that only a bot would fill in), are a bad idea, because screen readers would still pick them up. </p>

<p>Are screen readers really so primitive that they would read text that isn't even displayed on the screen?  Ideally, couldn't you make a screen reader that waited until the page was finished loading, applied all css, and even ran Javascript onload functions before it figured out what was actually displayed, and then read that off to the user?  You could probably even identify parts of the page that are menus or table of contents, and give some sort of easy way for those parts to be read exclusively or skipped over. I would think that the programming community could come up with a better solution to this problem.  </p>

Sadly, I can never really remember how it works and would like a tutorial with reference qualities to check up on every now and then. It should include:</p>

<ul>
<li>App.config / Web.config stuff to add for registering TraceListeners</li>
<li>how to set it up in the calling application</li>
</ul>

<p>Do you know the uber tutorial that we should link to?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Glenn Slaven pointed me in the right direction. Add this to your App.config/Web.config inside <code>&lt;configuration/&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;system.diagnostics&gt;
    &lt;trace autoflush=""true""&gt;
      &lt;listeners&gt;

      &lt;/listeners&gt;
    &lt;/trace&gt;
&lt;/system.diagnostics&gt;

<p>This will add a <code>TextWriterTraceListener</code> that will catch everything you send to with <code>Trace.WriteLine</code> etc.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> @DanEsparza pointed out that you should use <code>Trace.TraceInformation</code>, <code>Trace.TraceWarning</code> and <code>Trace.TraceError</code> instead of <code>Trace.WriteLine</code>, as they allow you to format messages the same way as <code>string.Format</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you don't add any listeners, then you can still see the trace output with the SysInternals program DebugView (<code>Dbgview.exe</code>): <a href=""http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896647.aspx"">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896647.aspx</a></p>

<p><strong>To clarify</strong>: I dont want it to break the build on <em>ANY</em> F6 (Build) press, I only want it to break the build if a method decorated with the attribute is called somewhere else in the code. Like I said, <em>similar</em> to obsolete, but not the same.</p>

<p>I'd like to add a scalar function to my script that gets the next available ID (i.e. last used ID + 1) but I'm not sure this is possible because there doesn't seem to be a way to use a global or static variable from within a UDF, I can't use a temp table, and I can't update a permanent table from within a function. </p>

<p>Currently my script looks like this: </p>

<pre>
   declare @v_baseID int 
   exec dbo.getNextID @v_baseID out  --sproc to get the next available id
   --Lots of these - where n is a hardcoded value
   insert into tableOfStuff (someStuff, uniqueID) values ('stuff', @v_baseID + n ) 
   exec dbo.UpdateNextID @v_baseID + lastUsedn  --sproc to update the last used id
</pre>

<p>But I would like it to look like this: </p>

<pre>
   --Lots of these
   insert into tableOfStuff (someStuff, uniqueID) values ('stuff', getNextID() ) 
</pre>

<p>Hardcoding the offset is a pain in the arse, and is error prone.  Packaging it up into a simple scalar function is very appealing, but I'm starting to think it can't be done that way since there doesn't seem to be a way to maintain the offset counter between calls.  Is that right, or is there something I'm missing.  </p>

<p>We're using SQL Server 2005 at the moment. </p>

<p><em>edits for clarification:</em></p>

<p>Two users hitting it won't happen.  This is an upgrade script that will be run only once, and never concurrently. </p>

<p>The actual sproc isn't prefixed with sp_, fixed the example code. </p>

<p>In normal usage, we do use an id table and a sproc to get IDs as needed, I was just looking for a cleaner way to do it in this script, which essentially just dumps a bunch of data into the db. </p>

<p>which I promptly fix (once I realize that the slave has been stopped) by doing the following:</p>

<pre><code>STOP SLAVE;
RESET SLAVE;
START SLAVE;

<p>... lately this has been getting kind of tiresome, and before I spit out some sort of PHP which does this for me, i was wondering if there's some my.cnf entry which will not kill the slave on the first error.</p>

<p>I've been working on a side project for some time now, and the further I get, the more my webpage has turned into a full-featured application. Right now, I'm sticking with <a href=""http://jquery.com"">jQuery</a>, however, the logic on the page is growing to a point where some organization, or dare I say it, ""architecture"" is needed. My first approach is ""MVC-ish"":</p>

<ul>
<li>The 'model' is a JSON tree that gets extended with helpers</li>
<li>The view is the DOM plus classes that tweak it</li>
<li>The controller is the object where I connect events handling and kick off view or model manipulation</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm very interested, however, in how other people have built more substantial javaScript apps. I'm not interested in GWT, or other server-oriented approaches... just in the approach of ""javaScript + &lt;generic web service-y thingy here&gt;""</p>

<p>Note: earlier I said javaScript ""is not really OO, not really functional"". This, I think, distracted everyone. Let's put it this way, because javaScript is unique in many ways, and I'm coming from a strongly-typed background, I don't want to force paradigms I know but were developed in very different languages.</p>

<p>The problem I'm having is that the commonly accepted code for this task:</p>

    {
        MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream(byteArrayIn);
        Image returnImage = Image.FromStream(ms, true);

<pre><code>Parameter Not Valid

So basically, given the name of the person, it is looked up in AD, then the Direct Reports are read.

Or, more abstract: The Tool will use a person as the root of the tree and then walk down the complete tree to get the names of all the leaves (can be several hundred)</p>

<p>Now, my concern is obviously performance, as this needs to be done quite a few times. My idea is to manually cache that (essentially just put all the names in a long string and store that somewhere and update it once a day).</p>

33510,958,2008-08-28T22:03:58Z,NA,2,What is the best approach to both modularity and platform independence?,"<p>I hope this question does not come off as broad as it may seem at first.  I am designing a software application in my <code>&lt;sarcasm&gt;</code><em>voluminous</em><code>&lt;/sarcasm&gt;</code> spare time.  I would like it to be both cross-platform and modular.  At this point, because I am still in the planning phase, I can pick practically any language and toolset.</p>

<p>This makes things harder, not easier, because there are seemingly so many ways of accomplishing both of the goals (modularity, platform agnosticism). </p>

<p>My basic premise is that security, data storage, interaction with the operating system, and configuration should all be handled by a ""container"" application - but most of the other functionality will be supplied through plug-in modules.  If I had to describe it at a high level (without completely giving away my idea), it would be a single application that can do many different jobs, all dedicated to the same goal (there are lots of disparate things to do, but all the data has to interact and be highly available).</p>

<p>This is not a new idea, and not particularly exotic.  Yet I find myself wrestling with not so much how to do it (I can think of lots of ways), but which method is best.</p>

<p>For example, I know that Eclipse practically embodies what I am describing, but I find Java applications in general (and Eclipse is no exception) to be too large and slow for what I need. Ditto desktop apps written Python and Ruby (which are excellent languages!)  </p>

<p>I don't mind recompiling the code base for different platforms as native exectables.  Yet, C and C++ have their own set of issues.</p>

It's fairly nifty, but I had some issues creating a custom label for a pie chart. They have an example for a line chart, which overrides an axis's series's label renderer.  My solution was to override the <code>myPieChart.dataTipFunction</code>. For data that looks like:</p>

<pre><code>myPieChart.dataProvider =
  [ { category: ""Groceries"", cost: 50 },
    { category: ""Transportation"", cost: 175} ]
myPieChart.dataField = ""cost"";
myPieChart.categoryField = ""category"";

<pre><code>import com.yahoo.astra.fl.charts.series.*
myPieChart.dataTipFunction = 
  function (obj:Object, index:int, series:ISeries):String {
    return obj.category + ""\n$"" + obj.cost;
  };
</code></pre>

<p>There's ceil(2.718281828459045) problems with this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I'm directly calling the category and cost properties of the data provider. The names are actually configurable when setting up the chart, I'd like to maintain that flexibility.</p></li>
<li><p>The default data tip would show the category, the cost (without a dollar sign), and the percentage it makes up in the pie chart. So here, I've lost the percentage. I just have no idea which property of what would hold that. It might be part of the series.</p></li>
<li><p>I probably only need to override the <code>dataItemRenderer</code> for the cost part of the series, but I don't know how to access it.  The documentation is a little ... lacking there.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Normally I would just look at the default implementation of the <code>dataTipFunction</code> but it's all inside a compiled shm that's part of the components distributed from yahoo.</p>

<p>Can anyone help me complete this overridden function with percentage information and the flexibility mentioned in point 1?</p>

This update happens whenever an associated select tag receives an onchange event.  The problem is, <code>&lt;select onchange=""this.form.submit();""&gt;</code>; doesn't work.  Nor does <code>document.forms[0].submit()</code>.  The only way to get the onsubmit code generated in the form_remote_tag to execute is to create a hidden submit button, and invoke the click method on the button from the select tag.  Here's a working ERb partial example.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% form_remote_tag :url =&gt; product_path, :update =&gt; 'content', :method =&gt; 'get' do -%&gt;
  &lt;% content_tag :div, :id =&gt; 'content' do -%&gt;

    &lt;%= submit_tag 'submit_button', :style =&gt; ""display: none"" %&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What I want to do is something like this, but it doesn't work.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% form_remote_tag :url =&gt; product_path, :update =&gt; 'content', :method =&gt; 'get' do -%&gt;
  &lt;% content_tag :div, :id =&gt; 'content' do -%&gt;
    # the following line does not work
    &lt;%= select_tag :update, options_for_select([[""foo"", 1], [""bar"", 2]]), :onchange =&gt; ""this.form.onsubmit()"" %&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So, is there any way to remove the invisible submit button for this use case?</p>

<p>There seems to be some confusion.  So, let me explain.  The basic problem is that <code>submit()</code> doesn't call the <code>onsubmit()</code> code rendered into the form.</p>

<p>The actual HTML form that Rails renders from this ERb looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action=""/products/1"" method=""post"" onsubmit=""new Ajax.Updater('content', '/products/1', {asynchronous:true, evalScripts:true, method:'get', parameters:Form.serialize(this)}); return false;""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""margin:0;padding:0""&gt;
    &lt;input name=""authenticity_token"" type=""hidden"" value=""4eacf78eb87e9262a0b631a8a6e417e9a5957cab"" /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id=""content""&gt;
    &lt;select id=""update"" name=""update"" onchange=""this.form.commit.click""&gt;
      &lt;option value=""1""&gt;foo&lt;/option&gt;
      &lt;option value=""2""&gt;bar&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;/select&gt;
    &lt;input name=""commit"" style=""display: none"" type=""submit"" value=""submit_button"" /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I want to axe the invisible submit button, but using a straight form.submit appears to not work.  So, I need some way to call the form's onsubmit event code.</p>

<p>Update: Orion Edwards solution would work if there wasn't a <code>return(false);</code> generated by Rails.  I'm not sure which is worse though, sending a phantom click to an invisible submit button or calling eval on the <code>getAttribute('onsubmit')</code> call after removing the return call with a javascript string replacement!   </p>

The rule of this hierarchy is that every CustID has a ParentID and if the CustID has no parent then the ParentID = CustID and it is the highest level.</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @LookupID int

--Our test value
SET @LookupID = 1

WITH cteLevelOne (ParentID, CustID) AS
(
    	SELECT   a.ParentID, a.CustID
    	FROM     tblCustomer AS a
    	WHERE    a.CustID = @LookupID
    UNION ALL
    	SELECT   a.ParentID, a.CustID
    	FROM     tblCustomer AS a
    	INNER JOIN cteLevelOne AS c ON a.CustID = c.ParentID
    	WHERE c.CustID &lt;&gt; a.CustomerID
)
</code></pre>

<p>So if tblCustomer looks like this:  </p>

<pre><code>ParentID    CustID
5            5
1            8
5            4
4            1

<p>The result I get from the code above is:  </p>

<pre><code>ParentID    CustID
4            1
5            4
5            5
</code></pre>

<p>What I want is just the last row of that result:  </p>

<pre><code>ParentID    CustID
5            5
</code></pre>

<p>How do I just return the last record generated in the CTE (which would be highest level CustID)?</p>

<p>Also note that there are multiple unrelated CustID hierarchies in this table so I can't just do a SELECT * FROM tblCustomer WHERE ParentID = CustID. I can't order by ParentID or CustID because the ID number is not related to where it is in the hierarchy.</p>

From the man pages I found two options:</p>

<p>And:</p>

<pre><code>Music::Artist-&gt;purge_object_index_every(2000);

<p>Now, when I add clear_object_index() to the DESTROY method, it seems to run, but doesn't actually empty the cache.  I am able to manually change the database, re-run the request, and it is still the old version.
purge_object_index_every says that it clears the index every n requests.  Setting this to ""1"" or ""0"", seems to clear the index... sometimes.  I'd expect one of those two to work, but for some reason it doesn't do it every time.  More like 1 in 5 times.</p>

<pre>
#light
let ListProduct l = List.fold_left (*) 1 l
</pre>

<p>Which inputs a list of ints and multiplies each element in the list, i.e. obtains the product of the list (e.g. a list of 1,2,3 would be calculated as 1*2*3=6). The closest C# equivilent, using LINQ and functional concepts is as follows:-</p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

...

public static class ListHelper {
  public static int ListProduct(List&lt;int&gt; l) {
    return l.Aggregate(1, (i, j) =&gt; i * j);
  }
}

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

...

public static class ListHelper {
  public static int ListProduct(List&lt;int&gt; l) {
    int ret = 1;
    foreach (int i in l) ret *= i;
    return ret;
  }
}
</code></pre>

Whenever I do /etc/init.d/yaws restart or a stop/start, it initializes according to an old version of the config file (/etc/yaws/yaws.conf).</p>

<p>I know this because I changed the docroot from the default to another directory (call it A), then a few weeks later changed it to directory B, and the config file has stayed with B for the last several months.  But then, after a restart, it switches back to A.  If it switched back to the package default, that would be understandable, but it switches to an old customized version instead.</p>

<p>The funny thing is that if I leave it stopped for several minutes, when I start it again, everything switches back to normal (using directory B).  But while it's stopped, if I run ps, I don't see any yaws-related processes (yaws, heart, etc).  This problem has survived several reboots, so it's got to be an old cached copy of the config somewhere, but I have yet to find anything like that.</p>

<p>Any idea what could be going on?</p>

<p>Update:
@Gorgapor - I stopped yaws, renamed the config file and tried to start it again.  It failed to start.  However, I was able to restart a couple of times and this time it didn't switch back to the old version.</p>

<p>The complete interface to this COM component corresponds to a software standard used in the chemical process industry (CAPE-OPEN) and as a result this COM component is supposed to be usable by a range of 3rd party executables that are out of my control.</p>

<p>My component works as expected in many of these EXEs, but for one in particular the Edit() method just hangs without the dialog appearing.</p>

<p>However, if I make a call to <code>::MessageBox()</code> immediately before <code>DoModal()</code> the dialog displays and behaves correctly after first showing the MessageBox.</p>

<p>I have a suspicion that the problem may be something to do with this particular EXE running as a 'hidden window application'.</p>

<p>I have tried using both NULL and the return value from <code>::GetConsoleWindow()</code> as the dialog's parent, neither have worked.</p>

<p>The dialog itself is an ATL/WTL CPropertySheetImpl.</p>

<p>The parent application (EXE) in question is out of my control as it is developed by a (mildly hostile) 3rd party.</p>

<p>I do know that I can successfully call <code>::MessageBox()</code> or display the standard Windows File Dialog from my COM component, and that after doing so I am then able to display my custom dialog. I'm just unable to display my custom dialog without first displaying a 'standard' dialog.</p>

<p>Can anyone suggest how I might get it to display the dialog without first showing an unnecessary MessageBox? I know it is possible because I've seen this EXE display the dialogs from other COM components corresponding to the same interface.</p>

Some of them I can, it seems that the first few I put on a page work, then it just stops. </p>

<p>I first thought it may be the type of control as initially I was trying to reference a repeater inside an update panel. I know I am correctly referencing the code behind in my aspx page. But just in case it was a  screw up on my part I started to recreate the page from scratch and this time got a few more controls down before VS stopped recognizing my controls.</p>

<p>After creating my page twice and getting stuck I thought maybe it was still the type of controls. I created a new page and just threw some labels on it. No dice, build fails when referencing the control from the code behind. </p>

<p>In a possibly unrelated note when I switch to the dreaded ""design"" mode of the aspx pages VS 2008 errors out and restarts. </p>

<p>I have already put a trouble ticket in to Microsoft. I uninstalled all add-ins, I reinstalled visual studio. </p>

<p>You get a screenful of stackoverflow questions by requesting <code>/questions ?sort=newest</code> page. Next page link leads to <code>/questions?page=2 &amp;sort=newest</code>. I suppose that at server side, the request is translated into an SQL query with LIMIT clause. Problem with this approach is, that if new question were added while user browses first page, his second page will start with some questions he already saw. (If he has 10 question per page, and 10 new questions happened to be added, he’ll get exactly the same content second time!)</p>

<p>Is there an elegant way to solve this common problem? I realize that it is not that big a problem, at least not for stackoverflow, but still.</p>

Server returns a page that starts with the requested answer, and puts the id of the first answer on the next page into next page link. There must be a way to write SQL for that, right? </p>

However, this one in particular has the need that some users will be offline, so they need to be able to download the DB to their machine, work on it, and then sync back once they're on the LAN.</p>

<p>I would like to note that I know this has been done before, I just don't have experience with this particular model.</p>

<p>One idea I thought about was using GUIDs as table keys. So for example, a Purchase Order would not have a number (auto-numeric) but a GUID instead, so that every offline client can generate those, and I don't have clashes when I connect back to the DB.</p>

<p>Is this a bad idea for some reason?
Will access to these tables through the GUID key be slow?</p>

<p>Have you had experience with these type of systems? How have you solved this problem?</p>

<p>Thanks!<br />

I've been looking at a few PHP framework recently, and it came down to two. The Zend Framework or CodeIgniter. </p>

<p>I prefer CodeIgniter, because of its simple design. It's very bare bone, and it is just kept simple. The thing I don't like though is the weak template system. The template system is important for me, because I will be working with another designer. Being able to give him a good template system is a big plus.</p>

<p>Zend was the second choice, because of the better template system that is built in. Zend is a different beast though compared to CodeIgniter. It emphasis ""loose coupling between modules"", but is a bigger framework. I don't like to feel like I have many things running under the hood that I never use. That is unnecessary overhead in my opinion, so I thought about putting a template system into CodeIgniter: Smarty.</p>

<p><strong>Question(s)</strong>: How easy/hard is the process to integrate Smarty into CodeIgniter? From my initial scan of the CodeIgniter documentation, I can see that the layout of the framework is easy enough to understand, and I anticipate no problems. I want to know if anyone has used it before, and therefore are aware of any ""gotchas"" you my have experienced that is going to make this harder than it should be or impossible to pull off. I also want to know if this is a good thing to do at all. Is the template system in CodeIgniter enough for normal use? Are there any other template modules that are good for CodeIgniter aside from Smarty? I better off with Zend Framework? Is any wheel being invented here? Thank you for your help! </p>

While developing the automated regression test, I ran across some behavior that's almost certainly a bug.  So, for now, I've modified the automated regression test to not register a failure--it's deliberately allowing this bad behavior to go by, I mean.  </p>

<p>So, I am interested in the opinions of others on this site.  Obviously, I'll add a bug to our defect tracking to make sure this error behavior gets fixed.  But are there any compelling reasons (either way) to either change the regression test to constantly indicate failure or leave the regression test broken and not have a failure until we can get to fixing the defective behavior?  I think of this as a 6 of one and a half-dozen of the other type of question but I ask here because I thought others may see it differently.</p>

<hr>

<p>@Paul Tomblin,</p>

<p>Just to be clear--I've never considered removing the test; I was simply considering modifying the pass/fail condition to allow for the failure without it being thrown up in my face every time I run the test. </p>

<p>I'm a little concerned about repeated failures from known causes eventually getting treated like warnings in C++.  I know developers who see warnings in their C++ code and simply ignore them because they think they're just useless noise.  I'm afraid leaving a known failure in the regression suite might cause people to start ignoring other, possibly more important, failures. </p>

<p>BTW, lest I be misunderstood, I consider warnings in C++ to be an important aid in crafting strong code but judging from other C++ developers I've met I think I'm in the minority.</p>

<p>Sometimes <code>session.Close</code> works, e.g., it commits all the changes that I need. I know I need to use commit when I have a transaction, or a unit of work with several creates/updates/deletes, so that I can choose to rollback if an error occurs.</p>

<p>But sometimes I really get stymied by the logic behind <code>session.Flush</code>. I have seen examples where you have a <code>session.SaveOrUpdate()</code> followed by a flush, but when I remove Flush it works fine anyway. Sometimes I run into errors on the Flush statement saying that the session timed out, and removing it made sure that I didn't run into that error.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a good guideline as to where or when to use a Flush? I've checked out the NHibernate documentation for this, but I still can't find a straightforward answer.</p>

What I am imagining is a set of rules off how you write your html, and what boxes, lists, menus and styles you are supposed to use. A set of standard test pages covering the various uses can be created, and a new CSS file while have to support all the different pages in a nice view.</p>

<p>I want to be able to generate a new (fully valid) MP3 file from an existing MP3 file to be used as a preview -- try-before-you-buy style. The new file should only contain the first <em>n</em> seconds of the track.</p>

<p>Now, I know I could just ""chop the stream"" at <em>n</em> seconds (calculating from the bitrate and header size) when delivering the file, but this is a bit dirty and a real PITA on a VBR track. I'd like to be able to generate a proper MP3 file.</p>

<p>Anyone any ideas?</p>

<p><strong>Answers</strong></p>

<p>Both mp3split and ffmpeg are both good solutions. I chose ffmpeg as it is commonly installed on linux servers and is also <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=205275&amp;package_id=248632"">easily available for windows</a>.  Here's some more good command line parameters for generating previews with ffmpeg</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>-t &lt;seconds&gt;</code></strong> chop after specified number of seconds</li>
<li><strong><code>-y</code></strong> force file overwrite</li>
<li><strong><code>-ab &lt;bitrate&gt;</code></strong> set bitrate e.g. <em>-ab 96k</em></li>
<li><strong><code>-ar &lt;rate Hz&gt;</code></strong> set sampling rate e.g. <em>-ar 22050</em> for 22.05kHz</li>
<li><strong><code>-map_meta_data &lt;outfile&gt;:&lt;infile&gt;</code></strong> copy track metadata from infile to outfile</li>
</ul>

<p>instead of setting -ab and -ar, you can copy the original track settings, as Tim Farley suggests, with:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>-acodec copy</code></strong></li>

<p>If I have a Dictionary which I'm access through properties, which of these formats would you prefer for the property?</p>

<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// This class's FirstProperty property
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
[DefaultValue(""myValue"")]
public string FirstProperty {
    get {
        return Dictionary[""myKey""];
    }
    set {
        Dictionary[""myKey""] = value;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This is probably the typical way of doing it. It's fairly efficient, easy to understand, etc. The only disadvantage is with a longer or more complex key it would be possible to misspell it or change only one instance or something, leading me to this:</p>

<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// This class's SecondProperty property
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
[DefaultValue(""myValue"")]
private const string DICT_MYKEY = ""myKey""
public string SecondProperty {
    get {
        return Dictionary[DICT_MYKEY];
    }
    set {
        Dictionary[DICT_MYKEY] = value;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Which is marginally more complicated, but seems to offer additional safety, and is closer to what I would think of as the ""Code Complete"" solution. The downside is that when you also have a ///  block and a [DefaultValue()] block above the property already, it starts getting a bit crowded up there.</p>

<p>So which do you like better, and why? Does anybody have any better ideas?</p>

Since I was originally using flora, I had mistakenly assumed that I have to specify a class attribute. Turns out, this is only true when you actually use the flora theme (as in the samples). If you use the customized theme, specifying a class attribute causes that strange behaviour.</p>

46030,1358,2008-09-05T15:25:11Z,NA,20,C# Force Form Focus,"<p>So, I did search google and SO prior to asking this question. Basically I have a DLL that has a form compiled into it. The form will be used to display information to the screen. Eventually it will be asynchronous and expose a lot of customization in the dll. For now I just want it to display properly. The problem that I am having is that I use the dll by loading it in a Powershell session. So when I try to display the form and get it to come to the top and have focus, It has no problem with displaying over all the other apps, but I can't for the life of me get it to display over the Powershell window. Here is the code that I am currently using to try and get it to display. I am sure that the majority of it won't be required once I figure it out, this just represents all the things that I found via google.</p>

<pre><code>CLass Blah

        [DllImport(""user32.dll"", EntryPoint = ""SystemParametersInfo"")]
        public static extern bool SystemParametersInfo(uint uiAction, uint uiParam, uint pvParam, uint fWinIni);

        public static extern bool SetForegroundWindow(IntPtr hWnd);

        [DllImport(""User32.dll"", EntryPoint = ""ShowWindowAsync"")]
        private static extern bool ShowWindowAsync(IntPtr hWnd, int cmdShow);
        private const int WS_SHOWNORMAL = 1;

    public void ShowMessage(string msg)
    {
            MessageForm msgFrm = new MessageForm();
            msgFrm.lblMessage.Text = ""FOO"";
            msgFrm.ShowDialog();
            msgFrm.BringToFront();
            msgFrm.TopMost = true;
            msgFrm.Activate();

            SystemParametersInfo((uint)0x2001, 0, 0, 0x0002 | 0x0001);
            ShowWindowAsync(msgFrm.Handle, WS_SHOWNORMAL);
            SetForegroundWindow(msgFrm.Handle);
            SystemParametersInfo((uint)0x2001, 200000, 200000, 0x0002 | 0x0001);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As I say I'm sure that most of that is either not needed or even flat out wrong, I just wanted to show the things that I had tried. Also, as I mentioned, I plan to have this be asynchronously displayed at some point which I suspect will wind up requiring a separate thread. Would splitting the form out into it's own thread make it easier to cause it to get focus over the Powershell session? </p>

<hr>

<p>@Joel, thanks for the info. Here is what I tried based on your suggestion:</p>

<pre><code>msgFrm.ShowDialog();
msgFrm.BringToFront();
msgFrm.Focus();
Application.DoEvents();
</code></pre>

<p>The form still comes up <em>under</em> the Powershell session. I'll proceed with working out the threading. I've spawned threads before but never where the parent thread needed to talk to the child thread, so we'll see how it goes.</p>

<p>Thnks for all the ideas so far folks.</p>

<hr>

<p>Ok, threading it took care of the problem. @Quarrelsome, I did try both of those. Neither (nor both together) worked. I am curious as to what is evil about using threading? I am not using Application.Run and I have yet to have a problem. I am using a mediator class that both the parent thread and the child thread have access to. In that object I am using a ReaderWriterLock to lock one property that represents the message that I want displayed on the form that the child thread creates. The parent locks the property then writes what should be displayed. The child thread locks the property and reads what it should change the label on the form to. The child has to do this on a polling interval (I default it to 500ms) which I'm not real happy about, but I could not find an event driven way to let the child thread know that the proerty had changed, so I'm stuck with polling.</p>

For every request, I get back (among other things) a list of which routes serve the stop in question. For example, if the list includes result for bus route #1, 2, and 5, then I know that those serve this stop.</p>

<p>I have a many-to-many relationship set up between Route and Stop, and I want to dynamically check and update these associations on every request. There is no ""master list"" of which routes serve which stops, so this seems like the best way to get this data.</p>

<p>I believe that the way I'm doing it now is very inefficient:</p>

<pre><code># routes is an array of [number, destination] that I build while iterating over the data
routes.uniq.each do |route|
  number      = route[0]
  destination = route[1]

  r = Route.find_by_number_and_destination(number, destination)

  if !r
    r = Route.new :number =&gt; number, :destination =&gt; destination
    r.save
  end

  # I have to check if it already exists because I can't find a way
  # to create a uniqueness constraint on the join table with 2 foreign keys
  r.stops &lt;&lt; stop unless r.stops.include? stop
end
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, I have to do 2 things for every route I find:
1) Create it if it doesn't already exist, 2) Add a relationship to the current stop if it doesn't already exist.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to do this, for example by getting a bunch of the data in memory and doing some of the processing on the app server side, in order to avoid the multitude of database calls I'm currently doing?</p>

49430,5170,2008-09-08T10:29:53Z,NA,1,Animation Extender Problems,"<p>I have just started working with the <code>AnimationExtender</code>.  I am using it to show a new div with a list gathered from a database when a button is pressed.  The problem is the button needs to do a postback to get this list as I don't want to make the call to the database unless it's needed.  The postback however stops the animation mid flow and resets it.  The button is within an update panel.</p>

<p>Ideally I would want the animation to start once the postback is complete and the list has been gathered.  I have looked into using the <code>ScriptManager</code> to detect when the postback is complete and have made some progress.  I have added two javascript methods to the page.</p>

<pre><code>function linkPostback() {

        var prm = Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManager.getInstance();
        prm.add_endRequest(playAnimation)
    }

    function playAnimation() {
        var onclkBehavior = $find(""ctl00_btnOpenList"").get_OnClickBehavior().get_animation();
        onclkBehavior.play();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And I’ve changed the <code>btnOpenList.OnClientClick=”linkPostback();”</code></p>

<p>This almost solves the problem.  I’m still get some animation stutter.  The animation starts to play before the postback and then plays properly after postback.  Using the <code>onclkBehavior.pause()</code> has no effect.  I can get around this by setting the <code>AnimationExtender.Enabled = false</code> and setting it to true in the buttons postback event.  This however works only once as now the AnimationExtender is enabled again.  I have also tried disabling the <code>AnimationExtender</code> via javascript but this has no effect.</p>

<p>Is there a way of playing the animations only via javascript calls?  I need to decouple the automatic link to the 
buttons click event so I can control when the animation is fired.</p>

<p>Hope that makes sense.</p>

<p>Of course, that's pretty nonsensical, but I'm wondering whether any strict behaviour is defined. Opera effectively rejects the 'selected' attribute and selects the next item in the list. All other browsers appear to allow it, and it remains selected.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> To clarify, I'm specifically interested in the initial selection. I'm dealing with one of those 'Select an item:'-type drop-downs, in which case the first option is really a label, and an action occurs onchange(). This is <em>fairly</em> well 'progressively enhanced', in that a submit button is present, and only removed via javascript. If the ""select..."" option were removed, whatever then were to become the first item would not be selectable. Are we just ruling out 'onchange' drop downs altogether, or should the ""select..."" option be selectable, just with no effect?</p>

<p>I will post my code below, but the problem is after it hits the first custom tag in the page, it calls it, and prints the response, but does not get anything that comes after it in the wikitext. It seems it just stops parsing the page.</p>

<p>Update: @George Mauer --  I have seen that as well, but this does not stop the page from rendering, just the Mediawiki engine from parsing the rest of the wikitext.

WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING being sent to the dialog's parent. For the ones that
leave the rest of the application behind, WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING is not being
sent to the dialog's parent.</p>

<p>Then there's subtle routing problems, where we do want to be notified:  /artists/ for example, or ///.  In these situations, we may want an error being thrown, or not... or we get Google sending us URLs which used to be valid but are no longer because people deleted them.</p>

<p>In each of these situations, I want a way to contain, analyze and filter the path that we get back, or at least some Railsy way to manage routing past the normal 'fallback catchall' url.  Does this exist?</p>

<pre><code># File vendor/rails/actionpack/lib/action_controller/rescue.rb, line 141

def rescue_action_without_handler(exception)
 log_error(exception) if logger
 erase_results if performed?

 # Let the exception alter the response if it wants.
 # For example, MethodNotAllowed sets the Allow header.
 if exception.respond_to?(:handle_response!)

 if consider_all_requests_local || local_request?
   rescue_action_locally(exception)
 else
  rescue_action_in_public(exception)

def should_log_exception_as_debug?(exception)

<p>I'd posted a list of software quality metrics that I could think of off the top of my head that included:</p>

<ol>
<li>McCabe Cyclometric Complexity - basically a measure of the number of linear paths through code.</li>
<li>Levels of indentation - a measure of complexity when looking at nested decision statements.</li>
<li>Distance from declaration to first use - how many statements exist between where a variable is declared and where it is first used.</li>
<li>Comment percentage - how many lines of code are comments compared to source code.</li>
<li>Percent test coverage - as a percentage of lines of code, how many are exercised by your suite of tests.</li>
<li>Path test coverage - how many paths of execution are exercised by your tests.</li>
<li>Unit coverage - how many individual units, classes, packages, etc., are exercised by your unit tests.</li>
</ol>

<p>Kris's comment was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Only the test-coverage metrics listed here could be considered a measure of ""quality."" The others are measurements of complexity and readability, which really has nothing to do with quality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apart from the fact that I don't agree with this statement at all, it got me thinking.</p>

<p>When I have to review code that has hardly any associated tests, whether unit, system or integration, I tend to approach the code much, much more warily than if I see a good suite of tests that have been successfully passed.</p>

<p>Same thing when performing security audits on code. If I see unused variables, huge functions, bizarre mixtures of configs, per server, per dir, etc. being used in Apache modules it also predisposes me to approach the code very warily.</p>

<p>Does anyone else use this initial ""gut feeling"" approach and does it affect the outcome?</p>

<p>BTW I don't agree with Kris's comment because all the other metrics are definitely valid measures that will help highlight badly designed, poorly executed code. As Damian Conway says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.</p>

51530,1709,2008-09-09T10:24:44Z,NA,0,How do you treat legacy code (and data)?,"<p>I am currently in the process of restructuring my local Subversion repository by adding some new projects and merging legacy code and data from a couple of older repositories into it. </p>

<p>When I have done this in the past I have usually put the legacy code in a dedicated ""legacy"" folder, as not to ""disturb"" the new and ""well-structured"" code tree. However, in the spirit of refactoring I feel this is somewhat wrong. In theory, the legacy code will be refactored over time and moved to its new location, but in practice this rarely happens.</p>

<p>How do you treat your legacy code? As much as I feel tempted to tuck away old sins in the ""legacy"" folder, never to look at it again, on some level I hope that by forcing it to live among the more ""healthy"" inhabitants in the repository, maybe the legacy code will have a better chance of getting well some day?</p>

<p>(Yeah, we all know <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html"" rel=""nofollow"">we shouldn't rewrite stuff</a>, but this is my ""fun"" repository, not my business projects...)</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I am not worried about the technical aspects of keeping track of various versions. I know how to use tags and branches for that. This is more of a psychological aspect, as I prefer to have a ""neat"" structure in the repository, which makes navigating it much easier&mdash;for humans.</p>

<p>When creating a chart for a given set of data items, I'd like to be able to give the algorithm: </p>

<ul>
<li>the maximum (y) value in the set </li>
<li>the minimum (y) value in the set </li>
<li>the number of tick marks to appear on the axis </li>
<li>an optional value that <strong>must</strong> appear as a tick (e.g. zero when showing +ve and -ve values)</li>
</ul>

<p>The algorithm should return</p>

<ul>
<li>the largest axis value </li>
<li>the smallest axis value (although that could be inferred from the largest, the interval size and the number of ticks)</li>
<li>the interval size </li>

<p>The ticks should be at a regular interval should be of a ""reasonable"" size (e.g. 1, 3, 5, possibly even 2.5, but not any more sig figs). </p>

<p>The presence of the optional value will skew this, but without that value the largest item should appear between the top two tick marks, the lowest value between the bottom two. </p>

When we chose Flash 6 years ago, we did so for its large number of features for user interaction, like dragging stuff, opening and closing menus, tree navigation elements, popup dialogs etc.</p>

<p>Today it's obvious that AJAX/JS offers roughly the same possibilities and because of the number of frameworks that are readily available, it's very feasible to implement them.</p>

<p>Is there a technical reason one should choose either technology over the other? By ""technical"", I mean performance, security, portability/compatibility and the like. I don't mean aspects such as the very non-programmer way development is done in Flash or whether it makes sense to switch an app from one to the other.</p>

Searching for ""Pattern"" hits way too many Q &amp; A's to be useful.</p>

<p>I'm working on a regression testing app.  I'm displaying a form on the screen and according to which user is logged in to the app some of the fields should be read-only.  So I can abstract a field object and I can abstract a user object but what pattern should I be looking at to describe the intersection of these two concepts?  In other words how should I describe that for Field 1 and User A, the field should be read-only?  It seems like read-only (or not) should be a property of the Field class but as I said, it depends on which user is looking at the form.  I've considered a simple two-dimensional array (e. g. ReadOnly[Field,User] = True) but I want to make sure I've picked the most effective structure to represent this.    </p>

<p>Are there any software design patterns regarding this kind of data structure?  Am I overcomplicating things--would a two-dimensional array be the best way to go here?

<p>I have a database containing stock price history. I want to select most recent prices for every stock that is listed. I know PostreSQL has a <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25224/joining-latest-of-various-usermetadata-tags-to-user-rows#27159"">DISTINCT ON</a> statement that would suit ideally here.</p>

<p>Table columns are <code>name</code>, <code>closingPrice</code> and <code>date</code>; <code>name</code> and <code>date</code> together form a unique index.</p>

<p>The <em>easiest</em> (and very uneffective) way is</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM stockPrices s
WHERE s.date =
(SELECT MAX(date) FROM stockPrices si WHERE si.name = s.name);
</code></pre>

<p>Much better approach I found is</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM stockPrices s JOIN (
  SELECT name, MAX(date) AS date
  FROM stockPrices si
  GROUP BY name
) lastEntry ON s.name = lastEntry.name AND s.date = lastEntry.date;

<p>What would be an efficient way to do this? What indexes should I create?</p>

<p>In his <a href=""http://aranworld.com/article/169/acl-and-auth-tutorial-database-setup"">examples</a> his user groups are set up as a cascading tree, with the most general user type being at the top of the tree, and its children branching off for each more restricted access type.

<p>I'm attempting to serialize pasteboard data in my application.  When another application places an RTF file on a pasteboard and then I ask for the available types, I get eleven different flavors of said RTF, everything from the original RTF to plain strings to dyn.* values.  </p>

<p>Saving off all that data into a plist or raw data on disk isn't usually a problem as it's  pretty small, but when an image of any considerable size is placed on the pasteboard, the resulting output can be tens of times larger than the source data (with multiple flavors of TIFF and PICT data being made available via filtering).</p>

<p>I'd like to just be able to save off what the original app made available if possible.</p>

<p>And while I accepted your answer as the correct answer, it doesn't exactly answer my original question.  What I was looking for was a way to identify flavors that can become  other flavors simply by placing them on the pasteboard <strong>AND</strong> to know which of these types were originally offered by the provider.  While walking the types list will get me the preferred order for the application that provided them, it won't tell me which ones I can safely ignore as they'll be recreated when I refill the pasteboard later.</p>

<p>I've come to the conclusion that there isn't a ""good"" way to do this.  <code>[NSPasteboard declaredTypesFromOwner]</code> would be fabulous, but it doesn't exist.</p>

<p>I understand prepared statements primarily provide a performance benefit, as well as some auxiliary bonuses such as not having to manually SQL-escape input data.</p>

<p>My question is about the performance part.</p>

<p>I have two implementations of a getPrice function below that takes a product id and returns its price.</p>

<p>getPrice_A reuses the same PDOStatement object across subsequent calls within the same script execution.  Is this necessary or recommended?  If so, is there any way to avoid duplicating this extra code across every single get*() in every single model?</p>

<p>getPrice_B creates a new PDOStatement object on every call.  Will the DBMS recognize this statement has already been prepared and still be able to skip some work?  In other words, does this implementation properly take advantage of the performance benefits of prepared statements?</p>

<p>Having written all this out and read it over, I imagine getPrice_B is fine and getPrice_A is providing a negligible benefit on top of that, which may or may not be worth the extra complication.</p>

<p>I'd still like to hear for sure from someone more knowledgable though.</p>

<p>Assume that <code>$pdo</code> is a valid, connected PDO object in the examples below.</p>

    static function &amp;getPrice_A($id) {

<p>Is this possible?</p>

<p>Edit: </p>

<p>To clarify, I have an update panel in one user control, the other update panels are in other user controls, so they can't see each other unless I were to expose some custom properties and use findControl etc etc...</p>

<p>Edit Again:</p>

<p>Here is what I came up with:</p>

<pre><code>public void Update()
{
    recursiveUpdate(this); 
}

private void recursiveUpdate(Control control)
{
    foreach (Control c in control.Controls)
    {
        if (c is UpdatePanel)
        {
            ((UpdatePanel)c).Update();
        }

        if (c.HasControls())
        {
            recursiveUpdate(c);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I had 3 main user controls that were full of update panels, these controls were visible to the main page, so I added an Update method there that called Update on those three.</p>

<p>In my triggering control, I just cast this.Page into the currentpage and called Update.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>AARRGGGG!</p>

<p>While the update panels refresh, it does not call Page_Load within the subcontrols in them...What do I do now!</p>

55340,3897,2008-09-10T21:15:12Z,NA,1,Bespoke SQL Server 'encoding' sproc - is there a neater way of doing this?,"<p>I'm just wondering if there's a better way of doing this in SQL Server 2005.</p>

<p>Effectively, I'm taking an originator_id (a number between 0 and 99) and a 'next_element' (it's really just a sequential counter between 1 and 999,999).
We are trying to create a 6-character 'code' from them. </p>

<p>The originator_id is multiplied up by a million, and then the counter added in, giving us a number between 0 and 99,999,999.</p>

<p>Then we convert this into a 'base 32' string - a fake base 32, where we're really just using 0-9 and A-Z but with a few of the more confusing alphanums removed for clarity (I, O, S, Z).</p>

<p>To do this, we just divide the number up by powers of 32, at each stage using the result we get for each power as an index for a character from our array of selected character.</p>

<pre>
Thus, an originator ID of 61 and NextCodeElement of 9 gives a code of '1T5JA9'

(61 * 1,000,000) + 9 = 61,000,009
61,000,009 div (5^32 = 33,554,432) =  1 = '1'
27,445,577 div (4^32 =  1,048,576) = 26 = 'T'
   182,601 div (3^32 =     32,768) =  5 = '5'
    18,761 div (2^32 =      1,024) = 18 = 'J'
       329 div (1^32 =         32) = 10 = 'A'
         9 div (0^32 =          1) =  9 = '9'

so my code is 1T5JA9
</pre>

<p>Previously I've had this algorithm working (in Delphi) but now I really need to be able to recreate it in SQL Server 2005.  Obviously I don't quite have the same functions to hand that I have in Delphi, but this is my take on the routine. It works, and I can generate codes (or reconstruct codes back into their components) just fine.</p>

<p>But it looks a bit long-winded, and I'm not sure that the trick of selecting the result of a division into an int (ie casting it, really) is necessarily 'right' - is there a better SQLS approach to this kind of thing?</p>

<pre>
CREATE procedure dummy_RP_CREATE_CODE @NextCodeElement int, @OriginatorID int,

  select @code='';

  -- add in the originator_id, scaled into place
  select @raw_num = (@OriginatorID * 1000000) + @NextCodeElement;

  -- now to convert this to a 6-char code

  -- 5^32
  select @chr = @raw_num / 33554432;
  select @raw_num = @raw_num - (@chr * 33554432);
  select @code = @code + SUBSTRING(@bcelems, 1 + @chr, 1);

  -- 4^32
  select @chr = @raw_num / 1048576;
  select @raw_num = @raw_num - (@chr * 1048576);
  select @code = @code + SUBSTRING(@bcelems, 1 + @chr, 1);

  select @chr = @raw_num / 32768;
  select @raw_num = @raw_num - (@chr * 32768);
  select @code = @code + SUBSTRING(@bcelems, 1 + @chr, 1);

  -- 2^32
  select @chr = @raw_num / 1024;
  select @raw_num = @raw_num - (@chr * 1024);
  select @code = @code + SUBSTRING(@bcelems, 1 + @chr, 1);

  -- 1^32
  select @chr = @raw_num / 32;
  select @raw_num = @raw_num - (@chr * 32);
  select @code = @code + SUBSTRING(@bcelems, 1 + @chr, 1);

  -- 0^32  
  select @code = @code + SUBSTRING(@bcelems, 1 + @raw_num, 1);

  -- that's it!
end;
</pre>

<p>I'm not desperately concerned about optimisation unless this method is actually an order of magnitude (or so) worse than any alternative. </p>

<p>The code only ever gets executed in small bursts, maybe generating 20 or 30 codes every 10 minutes or so. Because of the large range of numbers I don't want to pre-calculate the codes into a huge table (only small pockets of the overall code range will be used in any given installation).</p>

<p>However, I'm sure there's probably a tidier way of achieving the same result - particularly those divisions and subtractions.</p>

<p>We have a simple delete statement that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>DELETE FROM tablename WHERE pk = 12345

<p>This just hangs, no timeout, no nothing.</p>

<p>We've looked at the execution plan, and it consists of many lookups on related tables to ensure no foreign keys would trip up the delete, but we've verified that none of those other tables have any rows referring to that particular row.</p>

<p>There is no other user connected to the database at this time.</p>

<p>We've run DBCC CHECKDB against it, and it reports 0 errors.</p>

<p>Looking at the results of <em><code>sp_who</code></em> and <em><code>sp_lock</code></em> while the query is hanging, I notice that my spid has plenty of PAG and KEY locks, as well as the occasional TAB lock.</p>

<p>The table has 1.777.621 rows, and yes, pk is the primary key, so it's a single row delete based on index. There is no table scan in the execution plan, though I notice that it contains something that says <em>Table Spool (Eager Spool)</em>, but says Estimated number of rows 1. Can this actually be a table-scan in disguise? It only says it looks at the primary key column.</p>

<p>Tried DBCC DBREINDEX and UPDATE STATISTICS on the table. Both completed within reasonable time.</p>

<p>There is unfortunately a high number of indexes on this particular table. It is the core table in our system, with plenty of columns, and references, both outgoing and incoming. The exact number is 48 indexes + the primary key clustered index.</p>

<p>What else should we look at?</p>

It seems to me like it would give you more options on how the methods are called, allowing you to use it in a fluent-interface-like style and I can't really think of any disadvantages since you don't have to do anything with the return value (even store it).</p>

<p>So suppose you're in a situation where you want to update an object and then return its current value.
instead of saying </p>

<pre><code>myObj.Update();
var val = myObj.GetCurrentValue();

<pre><code>var val = myObj.Update()&lt;.GetCurrentValue();

<p>This operator would have a low order of precedence so myObj.Update() would execute first and then call  GetCurrentValue() on myObj instead of the void return of Update.</p>

57730,298,2008-09-11T21:40:05Z,NA,4,Best build process solution to manage build versions,"<p>I run a rather complex project with several independent applications. These use however a couple of shared components. So I have a source tree looking something like the below.</p>

<ul>
<li>My Project 
<ul>
<li>Application A</li>
<li>Shared1</li>
<li>Shared2 </li>
<li>Application B </li>
<li>Application C</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>All applications have their own MSBuild script that builds the project and all the shared resources it needs. I also run these builds on a CruiseControl controlled continuous integration build server. </p>

<p>When the applications are deployed they are deployed on several servers to distribute load. This means that it’s <em>extremely</em> important to keep track of what build/revision is deployed on each of the different servers (we need to have the current version in the DLL version, for example “1.0.0.68”). </p>

<p>It’s equally important to be able to recreate a revision/build that been built to be able to roll back if something didn’t work out as intended (o yes, that happends ...). Today we’re using SourceSafe for source control but that possible to change if we could present good reasons for that (SS it’s actually working ok for us <em>so</em> far). </p>

<p>Another principle that we try to follow is that it’s only code that been build and tested by the integration server that we deploy further. </p>

<h2>""CrusieControl Build Labels"" solution</h2>

<p>We had several ideas on solving the above. The first was to have the continuous integration server build and locally deploy the project and test it (it does that now). As you probably know a successful build in CruiseControl generates a build label and I guess we somehow could use that to set the DLL version of our executables (so build label 35 would create a DLL like “1.0.0.35” )? The idea was also to use this build label to label the <strong>complete</strong> source tree. Then we probably could check out by that label and recreate the build later on. </p>

<p>The reason for labeling the complete tree is to include not only the actual application code (that’s in one place in the source tree) but also all the shared items (that’s in different places in the tree). So a successful build of “Application A” would label to whole tree with label “ApplicationA35” for example. </p>

<p>There might however be an issue when trying to recreate this build and setting the DLL version before deploying as we then don’t have access to the CruiseControl generated build label anymore. If all CrusieControl build labels were unique for all the projects we could use only the number for labeling but that’s not the case (both application A and B could at the same time be on build 35) so we have to include the application name in the label. Hence SourceSafe label “Application35”. <strong>How can I then recreate build 34 and set 1.0.0.34 to the DLL version numbers once we built build 35?</strong></p>

<h2>""Revision number"" solution</h2>

<p>Someone told me that Subversion for example creates a revision number for the entire source tree on every check in – <strong>is this the case? Has SourceSafe something similar?</strong> If this is correct the idea is then to grab that revision number when getting latest and build on the CruiseControl server. The revision number could then be used to set the DLL version number (to for example “1.0.0.5678”). I guess we could then get this specific revision for the Subversion if needed and that then would include that application and all the shared items to be able to recreate a specific version from the past. <strong>Would that work and could this also be achived using SourceSafe?</strong></p>

<h2>Summarize</h2>

<p>So the two main requirements are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Be able to <strong>track build/revision number of the build and deployed DLL.</strong></li>
<li>Be able to <strong>rebuild a past revision/build, set the old build/revision number on the executables of that build</strong> (to comply with requirement 1).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>So how would you solve this?</strong> What would be your preferred approach and <strong>how</strong> would you solve it (or do you have a totally different idea?)? **Pleased give detailed answers. **</p>

<p><em>Bonus question</em> What are the difference between a revision number and a build number and when would one really need both?</p>

The problem primarily occurs because the build that the developers do on their local machines is fundamentally different from the build that occurs on the build machine. The devs are building the projects using <code>FlexBuilder/eclipse</code> and the build machine is using the command line compilers. Inevitably, the <code>{projectname}-config.xml</code> and/or the batch file that runs the build get out of sync with the project files used by eclipse, so the the build succeeds on the dev's machine, but fails on the build machine.</p>

<p>We started down the path of writing a utility program to convert FlexBuilder's project files into a <code>{projectname}-config.xml</code> file, but it's a) undocumented and b) a horrible hack.</p>

<p>I've looked into the -dump-config switch to get the config files, but this has a couple of problems: 1) The generated config file has absolute paths which doesn't work in our environment (some developers use macs, some windows machines), and 2) only works right when run from the IDE, so can't be build into the build process.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, we are going to discuss a couple of options, neither of which I'm terribly fond of:</p>

<p><strong>a)</strong> Add a post check-in event to Subversion to remove these absolute references, or <br>
<strong>b)</strong> add a pre-build process that removes the absolute reference.</p>

<p>What I'm after is basically pointing the application at an assembly and choosing a given class from which to select properties that should be included in an exported HTML form as fields. That form will be then used in my ASP.NET MVC app as the beginning of a View.</p>

<p>As I'm using Subsonic objects for the applications where I want to use, this should be reasonable and I figured that, by wanting to include things like differing output HTML depending on data type, Reflection was the way to get this done.</p>

<p>What I'm looking for, however, seems to be elusive. I'm trying to take the DLL/EXE that's chosen through the OpenFileDialog as the starting point and load it:</p>

<pre><code>String FilePath = Path.GetDirectoryName(FileName);
System.Reflection.Assembly o = System.Reflection.Assembly.LoadFile(FileName);
</code></pre>

<p>That works fine, but because Subsonic-generated objects actually are full of object types that are defined in Subsonic.dll, etc., those dependent objects aren't loaded. Enter:</p>

<pre><code>AssemblyName[] ReferencedAssemblies = o.GetReferencedAssemblies();
</code></pre>

<p>That, too, contains exactly what I would expect it to. However, what I'm trying to figure out is how to load those assemblies so that my digging into my objects will work properly. I understand that if those assemblies were in the GAC or in the directory of the running executable, I could just load them by their name, but that isn't likely to be the case for this use case and it's my primary use case.</p>

<p>So, what it boils down to is how do I load a given assembly and all of its arbitrary assemblies starting with a filename and resulting in a completely Reflection-browsable tree of types, properties, methods, etc.</p>

<p>I know that tools like Reflector do this, I just can't find the syntax for getting at it. </p>

<p>If the querysource you do the contains with has more than 10 items in it, it does not pass the items correctly to the SQL query. It is hard to explain what it does, an example will show it best.</p>

<p>If you look at the raw query, the parameters look like this:</p>

<pre><code>@P0 = 'aaa'
@P1 = 'bbb'
@P2 = 'ccc'
... [@P3 through @P9]
@P10 = '111'
@P11 = '222'
... [@p12 through @P19]
@P20 = 'sss'
... [@P21 through @P99]
@P100 = 'qqq'
</code></pre>

<p>when the values are passed into the final query (all parameters resolved) it has resolved the parameters as if these were the values passed:</p>

<pre><code>@P0 = 'aaa'
@P1 = 'bbb'
@P2 = 'ccc'
...
@P10 = 'bbb'0
@P11 = 'bbb'1
...
@P20 = 'ccc'0
...
@P100 = 'bbb'00
</code></pre>

<p>So it looks like the parameter resolving looks at the first digit only after the <code>@P</code> and resolves that, then adds on anything left at the end of the parameter name.</p>

<p>At least that is what the Sql Server Query Visualizer plugin to Visual Studio shows the query doing.</p>

<p>Really strange.</p>

<p>So if any one has advice please share. Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong><br>
I have rewritten the original linq statement to where I now use a join instead of the Contains, but would still like to know if there is a way around this issue.</p>

60830,123,2008-09-13T20:25:07Z,NA,33,What is wrong with using inline functions?,"<p>While it would be very convenient to use inline functions at some situations,</p>

<p>Are there any drawbacks with inline functions?</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</p>

<p>Apparently, There is nothing wrong with using inline functions.</p>

<p>But it is worth noting the following points!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Overuse of inlining can actually make programs slower. Depending on a function's size, inlining it can cause the code size to increase or decrease. Inlining a very small accessor function will usually decrease code size while inlining a very large function can dramatically increase code size. On modern processors smaller code usually runs faster due to better use of the instruction cache. <a href=""http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml#Inline_Functions"">- Google Guidelines</a></p></li>
<li><p>The speed benefits of inline functions tend to diminish as the function grows in size. At some point the overhead of the function call becomes small compared to the execution of the function body, and the benefit is lost <a href=""http://www-rocq.inria.fr/who/Marc.Thiriet/Langages/tic0324.html"">- Source</a></p></li>
<li><p>There are few situations where an inline function may not work:</p>

<ul>
<li>For a function returning values; if a return statement exists.</li>
<li>For a function not returning any values; if a loop, switch or goto statement exists. </li>
<li>If a function is recursive. <a href=""http://www-rocq.inria.fr/who/Marc.Thiriet/Langages/tic0324.html"">-Source</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The <code>__inline</code> keyword causes a function to be inlined only if you specify the optimize option. If optimize is specified, whether or not <code>__inline</code> is honored depends on the setting of the inline optimizer option. By default, the inline option is in effect whenever the optimizer is run. If you specify optimize , you must also specify the noinline option if you want the <code>__inline</code> keyword to be ignored. <a href=""http://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/sasc/doc750/html/clug/zcoptinl.htm"">-Source</a></p></li>

<p>I recently used a <a href=""http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html"">Maven structure</a> for a java project, but I am not sure it's the best structure for a non-maven driven project.</p>

<p>So, I have two questions: When you guys start new projects, what structure you use? And: What if you need to integrate two different languages, like for example java classes into a PHP application; PHP files are source files, web files, you you use a /src, /classes, webapps/php ? What are your choices in such scenarios. </p>

<p>As a note: I am wondering also what are you choices for directories names. I like the 3-letters names (src, lib, bin, web, img, css, xml, cfg) but what are your opinions about descriptive names like libraris, sources or htdocs/public_html ?</p>

61110,4850,2008-09-14T03:50:10Z,NA,10,How to save the output of a console application,"<p>I need advice on how to have my C# console application display text to the user through the standard output while still being able access it later on. The actual feature I would like to implement is to dump the entire output buffer to a text file at the end of program execution.</p>

<p>The workaround I use while I don't find a cleaner approach is to subclass <code>TextWriter</code> overriding the writing methods so they would both write to a file and call the original stdout writer. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class DirtyWorkaround {
  private class DirtyWriter : TextWriter {
    private TextWriter stdoutWriter;
    private StreamWriter fileWriter;

    public DirtyWriter(string path, TextWriter stdoutWriter) {
      this.stdoutWriter = stdoutWriter;
      this.fileWriter = new StreamWriter(path);
    }

    override public void Write(string s) {
      stdoutWriter.Write(s);

      fileWriter.Write(s);
      fileWriter.Flush();
    }

    // Same as above for WriteLine() and WriteLine(string),
    // plus whatever methods I need to override to inherit
    // from TextWriter (Encoding.Get I guess).
  }

  public static void Main(string[] args) {
    using (DirtyWriter dw = new DirtyWriter(""path"", Console.Out)) {
      Console.SetOut(dw);

      // Teh codez
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>See that it writes to and flushes the file all the time. I'd love to do it only at the end of the execution, but I couldn't find any way to access to the output buffer.</p>

<p>Also, excuse inaccuracies with the above code (had to write it <em>ad hoc</em>, sorry ;).</p>

61150,3087,2008-09-14T05:31:57Z,NA,31,Mocking Static Blocks in Java,"<p>My motto for Java is ""just because Java has static blocks, it doesn't mean that you should be using them."" Jokes aside, there are a lot of tricks in Java that make testing a nightmare. Two of the most I hate are Anonymous Classes and Static Blocks. We have a lot of legacy code that make use of Static Blocks and these are one of the annoying points in our push in writing unit tests. Our goal is to be able to write unit tests for classes that depend on this static initialization with minimal code changes. </p>

<p>So far my suggestion to my colleagues is to move the body of the static block into a private static method and call it <code>staticInit</code>. This method can then be called from within the static block. For unit testing another class that depends on this class could easily mock <code>staticInit</code> with JMockit to not do anything. Let's see this in example.</p>

<pre><code>public class ClassWithStaticInit {
  static {
    System.out.println(""static initializer."");
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Will be changed to</p>

<pre><code>public class ClassWithStaticInit {
  static {
    staticInit();
  }

  private static void staticInit() {
    System.out.println(""static initialized."");
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So that we can do the following in a JUnit.</p>

<pre><code>public class DependentClassTest {
  public static class MockClassWithStaticInit {
    public static void staticInit() {
    }
  }

  @BeforeClass
  public static void setUpBeforeClass() {
    Mockit.redefineMethods(ClassWithStaticInit.class, MockClassWithStaticInit.class);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However this solution also comes with its own problems. You can't run <code>DependentClassTest</code> and <code>ClassWithStaticInitTest</code> on the same JVM since you actually want the static block to run for <code>ClassWithStaticInitTest</code>.</p>

<p>What would be your way of accomplishing this task? Or any better, non-JMockit based solutions that you think would work cleaner?</p>

<p>First, what should be the role of testers, designers and non-developers as a whole in the Scrum process?
If they are equal to other team members a couple of issues arise. Designers and testers usually work on a task after development is done, so they cannot adequately plan for a sprint because of this dependency.  </p>

<p>Second, we have deadlines. These are strict and have a lot of impact on prioritization. The end result is backlog changes in the middle of a sprint because of deadline changes, or bad results in the end of the sprint.
We also have a lot of non-technical work like customer support that has to be done in the meantime and cannot be planned as it varies a lot.
So I'm thinking that the team structure, culture and practices are kind of not compatible with Scrum. Scrum for me is a process management tool for teams working on the development of a single software product.  </p>

63720,7961,2008-09-15T15:05:05Z,NA,4,Does Vista do stricter checking of Interface Ids in DCOM calls? (the Stub received bad Data)?,"<p>I hope everyone will pardon the length, and narrative fashion, of this question.  I decided to describe the situation in some detail in my blog.  I later saw Joel's invitation to this site, and I thought I'd paste it here to see if anyone has any insight into the situation.</p>

<p>I wrote, and now support, an application that consists of a Visual Basic thick client speaking DCOM to middle tier COM+ components written in C++ using ATL. It runs in all eight of our offices.  Each office hosts a back-end server that contains the COM+ application (consisting of 18 separate components) and the SQLServer. The SQLServer is typically on the same back-end server, but need not be.</p>

<p>We recently migrated the back-end server in our largest office -- New York -- from a MSC cluster to a new virtual machine hosted on VMWare's ESX technology. Since the location of the COM+ application had moved from the old server to a new one with a different name, I had to redirect all the clients so that they activated the COM+ application on the new server. The procedure was old hat as I had done essentially the same thing for several of my smaller offices that had gone through similar infrastructure upgrades.</p>

<p>All seemed routine and on Monday morning the entire office -- about 1,000 Windows XP workstations -- were running without incident on the new server. But then the call came from my mobile group -- there was an attorney working from home with a VPN connection that was getting a strange error after being redirected to the new server:</p>

<pre>
Error on FillTreeView2 - The stub received bad data.
</pre>

<p>Huh? I had never seen this error message before. Was it the new server? But all the workstations in the office were working fine. I told the mobile group to switch the attorney back to the old sever (which was still up), and the error disappeared. So what was the difference? Turns out this attorney was running Vista at home.</p>

<p>We don't run Vista in any of our offices, but we do have some attorneys that run Vista at home (certainly some in my New York office). I do as well and I've never seen this problem. To confirm that there was an issue, I fired up my Vista laptop, pointed it to the new server, and got the same error. I pointed it back to the old server, and it worked fine. Clearly there was some problem with Vista and the components on the new server -- a problem that did not seem to affect XP clients. What could it be?</p>

<p>Next stop -- the application error log on my laptop. This yielded more information on the error:</p>

<pre>
Source:        Microsoft-Windows-RPC-Events

Description:   Application has failed to complete a COM call because an incorrect
interface ID was passed as a parameter.

The expected Interface ID was 00000555-0000-0010-8000-00aa006d2ea4, 
The Interface ID returned was 00000556-0000-0010-8000-00aa006d2ea4.

User Action - Contact the application vendor for updated version of the application.
</pre>

<p>The interface ids provided the clue I needed to unravel the mystery. The ""expected"" interface id identifies MDAC's Recordset interface -- specifically version 2.1 of that interface. The ""returned"" interface corresponds to a later version of Recordset (version 2.5 which differs from version 2.1 by the inclusion of one additional entry at the end of the vtable -- method Save).</p>

<p>Indeed my component's interfaces expose many methods that pass Recordset as an output parameter. So were they suddenly returning a later version of Recordset -- with a different interface id? It certainly appeared to be the case. And then I thought, why should it matter. The vtable looks the same to clients of the older interface. Indeed, I suspect that if we were talking about in-process COM, and not DCOM, this apparently innocuous impedance mismatch would have been silently ignored and would have caused no issues.</p>

<p>Of course, when process and machine boundaries come into play, there is a proxy and a stub between the client and the server. In this case, I was using type library marshaling with the free threaded marshaller. So there were two mysteries to solve:</p>

<p>Why was I returning a different interface in the output parameters from methods on my new server?</p>

<p>Why did this affect only Vista clients?</p>

<p>As my server software was hosted on servers at each of my eight offices, I decided to try pointing my Vista client at all of them in sequence to see which had problems with Vista and which didn't. Illuminating test. Some of the older servers still worked with Vista but the newer ones did not. Although some of the older servers were still running Windows 2000 while the newer ones were at 2003, that did not seem to be the issue.</p>

<p>After comparing the dates of the component DLLs it appeared that whenever the client pointed to servers with component DLLs dated before 2003 Vista was fine. But those that had DLLs with dates after 2003 were problematic. Believe it or nor, there were no (or at least no significant) changes to the code on the server components in many years. Apparently the differing dates were simply due to recompiles of my components on my development machine(s). And it appeared that one of those recompiles happened in 2003.</p>

<p>The light bulb went on. When passing Recordsets back from server to client, my ATL C++ components refer to the interface as _Recordset. This symbol comes from the type library embedded within msado15.dll. This is the line I had in the C++ code:</p>

<pre>
#import ""c:\Program Files\Common Files\System\ADO\msado15.dll"" no_namespace rename ( ""EOF"", ""adoEOF"" )
</pre>

<p>Don't be deceived by the 15 in msdad15.dll. Apparently this DLL has not changed name in the long series of MDAC versions.</p>

<p>When I compiled the application back in the day, the version of MDAC was 2.1. So _Recordset compiled with the 2.1 interface id and that is the interface returned by the servers running those components.</p>

<p>All the client's use the COM+ application proxy that was generated (I believe) back in 1999. The type library that defines my interfaces includes the line:</p>

<pre>
importlib(""msado21.tlb"");
</pre>

<p>which explains why they expect version 2.1 of Recordset in my method's output parameters. Clearly the problem was with my 2003 recompile and the fact that at that time the _Recordset symbol no longer corresponded to version 2.1. Indeed _Recordset corresponded to the 2.5 version with its distinct interface id. The solution for me was to change all references from _Recordset to Recordset21 in my C++ code. I rebuilt the components and deployed them to the new server. Voila -- the clients seemed happy again.</p>

<p>In conclusion, there are two nagging questions that remain for me.</p>

<p>Why does the proxy/stub infrastructure seem to behave differently with Vista clients? It appears that Vista is making stricter checks of the interface ids coming back from method parameters than is XP.</p>

<p>How should I have coded this differently back in 1999 so that this would not have happened? Interfaces are supposed to be immutable and when I recompiled under a newer version of MDAC, I inadvertently changed my interface because the methods now returned a different Recordset interface as an output parameter. As far as I know, the type library back then did not have a version-specific symbol -- that is, later versions of the MDAC type libraries define Recordset21, but that symbol was not available back in the 2.1 type library.</p>

<p>In my game engine, I have designed a ""chase cam"" of sorts, that can be attached to an object and then recalculates its position relative to the object. When the object moves, there are two ways to update the chase cam.</p>

<li>Have an ""UpdateCameras()"" method in the main game loop.</li>
<li>Use an event handler, and have the chase cam subscribe to object.OnMoved.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm using the latter, because it allows me to chain events together and nicely automate large parts of the engine. Suddenly, what would be huge and complex get dropped down to a handful of 3-5 line event handlers...Its a beauty.</p>

<p>My boss is convinced that compiling our (<strong><em>my</em></strong>) webapp into a binary executable is a brilliant idea.  (Then again, he likes nice, small simple things with blinky lights that he can understand.)  He instinctively sees no issues with this, while I only see an endless series of problems and degradations.  Once I start talking to him about the complexity of our platform, and more in depth specifics of byte code, JVMs, libraries, differences between operating systems, processor architectures, etc...well...his eyes glaze over, he smiles and he has made it clear he thinks I'm being childishly resistive.</p>

<p>Why does he want a single magic executable?  He sees a couple of ""benefits"":</p>

<ul>
<li>If it is a binary executable, then it is hard to reverse engineer and circumvent any licensing.  Management lives in constant fear that this is happening, even though we sell into larger corporates who generally do not do cheat with server software.  </li>
<li>There is that vision of downloading this magic executable, running it, and everything works. (No more sending me out to do customer installations, which is not that frequent.)</li>
</ul>

<p>So, I've done my obligatory 20 minutes of googling, and now I am here.  </p>

<p>A bit of background on my application: </p>

<p><strong>What it is made from:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Java 6 (Sun's JVM)</li>
<li>AspectJ 1.6</li>
<li>Tomcat 6</li>
<li>Hibernate 3</li>
<li>Spring 2</li>
<li>another two dozen supporting jar files</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What it does</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A streaming media CMS</li>
<li>Performance sensitive</li>
<li>Deployed on Linux, Solaris, Windows (and developed on a Mac)</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can probably gather, I'm highly skeptical of this <em>""compiling Java to native code""</em> thing.  It sound like where Mono (VB on Linux) was back in 2000.  But am I being overly pessimistic?  Is it viable?  Should I actually spend the time (days if not weeks) to try this out?</p>

<p>There is one other similar thread (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/53845/java-compiler-options-to-produce-exe-files"">Java Compiler Options to produce .exe files</a>) but it is a bit too simple, the links dated, and not really geared towards a server-side question.</p>

I do not want any form of anti-aliasing (again, pixel level control is required.) I would like the users interactions on the screen to be quick and responsive (pending my ability to write fast algorithms.)</p>

<p>Ideally, I would like to write this in Python, or perhaps Java as a second choice. The ability to easily make the final app cross-platform is a must. I will submit to different API's on different OS'es if necessary as long as I can write an abstraction layer around them. Any ideas?</p>

<p>addendum: I need the ability to draw <em>on-screen</em>. Drawing out to a file I've got figured out.</p>

<p>This is happening within a minute of starting the script, so it is not a timeout issue. Also, <code>mediumtext_field</code> should be able to hold ~16MB of data, so that shouldn't be a problem.</p>

The property is available, you could set it but it has no effect. If you change the back color of the pages and not of the tab control it looks... uhm quite ugly.</p>

<p>I know Microsoft doesn't want it to be set. <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en/library/w4sc610z(VS.80).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">MSDN</a>: '<i>This property supports the .NET Framework infrastructure and is not intended to be used directly from your code. This member is not meaningful for this control.</i>' A control property just for color which supports the .NET infrastructure? ...hard to believe.</p>

<p>I hoped over the years Microsoft would change it but they did not. I created my own TabControl class which overrides the paint method to fix this. But is this really the best solution?</p>

<p>What is the reason for not supporting BackColor for this control? What is your solution to fix this? Is there a better solution than overriding the paint method?</p>

67370,64,2008-09-15T21:52:15Z,NA,10,Dynamically Create a generic type for template,"<p>I'm programming WCF using the ChannelFactory which expects a type in order to call the CreateChannel method. For example: </p>

<pre><code>IProxy proxy = ChannelFactory&lt;IProxy&gt;.CreateChannel(...);
</code></pre>

<p>In my case I'm doing routing so I don't know what type my channel factory will be using. I can parse a message header to determine the type but I hit a brick wall there because even if I have an instance of Type I can't pass that where ChannelFactory expects a generic type. </p>

<p>Another way of restating this problem in very simple terms would be that I'm attempting to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>string listtype = Console.ReadLine(); // say ""System.Int32""
Type t = Type.GetType( listtype);
List&lt;t&gt; myIntegers = new List&lt;&gt;(); // does not compile, expects a ""type""
List&lt;typeof(t)&gt; myIntegers = new List&lt;typeof(t)&gt;(); // interesting - type must resolve at compile time?
</code></pre>

<p>Is there an approach to this I can leverage within C#?</p>
