<p>I'm not sure this is exactly what you want, but this is one way to randomly generate non-repeating color values:</p>

<p>(beware, inconsistent pseudo-code ahead)</p>

<pre><code>//colors entered as 0-255 [R, G, B]<br>colors = []; //holds final colors to be used<br>rand = new Random();<br><br>//assumes n is less than 16,777,216<br>randomGen(int n){<br>   while (len(colors) &lt; n){<br>      //generate a random number between 0,255 for each color<br>      newRed = rand.next(256);<br>      newGreen = rand.next(256);<br>      newBlue = rand.next(256);<br>      temp = [newRed, newGreen, newBlue];<br>      //only adds new colors to the array<br>      if temp not in colors {<br>         colors.append(temp);<br>      }<br>   }<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>One way you could optimize this for better visibility would be to compare the distance between each new color and all the colors in the array:</p>

<pre><code>for item in color{<br>   itemSq = (item[0]^2 + item[1]^2 + item[2]^2])^(.5);<br>   tempSq = (temp[0]^2 + temp[1]^2 + temp[2]^2])^(.5);<br>   dist = itemSq - tempSq;<br>   dist = abs(dist);<br>}<br>//NUMBER can be your chosen distance apart.<br>if dist &lt; NUMBER and temp not in colors {<br>   colors.append(temp);<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>But this approach would significantly slow down your algorithm.</p>

<p>Another way would be to scrap the randomness and systematically go through every 4 values and add a color to an array in the above example.</p>"
269,91,2008-08-01T23:49:57Z,260,4,"<p>Yes, I thought about that, but I soon figured out that another Domain-Specific-Language (DSL) would be a bit too much.</p>

<p>Essentially, they need to interact with my gamestate in possibly unpredictable ways. For example, a card could have a rule ""When this cards enter play, all your undead minions gain +3 attack against flying enemies, except when the enemy is blessed"". As trading card games are turn based, the GameState Manager will fire OnStageX events and let the cards modify other cards or the GameState in whatever way the card needs.</p>

<p>If I try to create a DSL, I have to implement a rather large feature set and possibly constantly update it, which shifts the maintenance work to another part without actually removing it.</p>

<p>That's why I wanted to stay with a ""real"" .NET language to essentially be able to just fire the event and let the card manipulate the gamestate in whatever way (within the limits of the code access security).</p>

332,59,2008-08-02T03:00:24Z,330,19,"<p>I would be a bit reluctant to use nested classes here.  What if you created an abstract base class for a ""multimedia driver"" to handle the back-end stuff (workhorse), and a separate class for the front-end work?  The front-end class could take a pointer/reference to an implemented driver class (for the appropriate media type and situation) and perform the abstract operations on the workhorse structure.</p>

<p>My philosophy would be to go ahead and make both structures accessible to the client in a polished way, just under the assumption they would be used in tandem.</p>

<p>I would reference something like a <a href=""http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qtextdocument.html"">QTextDocument</a> in Qt.  You provide a direct interface to the bare metal data handling, but pass the authority along to an object like a QTextEdit to do the manipulation.</p>

<p>Otherwise I'd suggest you have a directory where you place precompiled assemblies. Then you could have a reference in the DB to the assembly and class, and use reflection to load the proper assemblies at runtime.</p>

<p>If you really want to compile at run-time you could use the CodeDOM, then you could use reflection to load the dynamic assembly. <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.csharp.csharpcodeprovider.aspx"">MSDN article which might help</a>.</p>"

473,49,2008-08-02T15:33:13Z,470,8,"<p>No, what you're doing is fine. Don't let those people confuse you.</p>

<p>If you've written the web services with .net then the reference proxies generated by .net are going to be quite suitable. The situation you describe (where you are both producer and consumer) is the ideal situation.</p>

<p>If you need to connect to a web services that is <em>unknown</em> at compile time, then you would want a more dynamic approach, where you deduce the 'shape' of the web service. </p>

<p>But start by using the auto generated proxy class, and don't worry about it until you hit a limitation. And when you do -- come back to stack overflow ;-)</p>"
529,86,2008-08-02T18:16:07Z,180,3,"<p>Isn't it also a factor which order you set up the colors?</p>

<p>Like if you use Dillie-Os idea you need to mix the colors as much as possible. 
0 64 128 256 is from one to the next. but 0 256 64 128 in a wheel would be more ""apart""</p>

<p>Does this make sense?</p>"
539,157,2008-08-02T19:03:52Z,180,21,"<p>My first thought on this is ""how generate N vectors in a space that maximize distance from each other."" You can see that the RGB (or any other scale you use that forms a basis in color space) are just vectors. Take a look at <a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/topics/RandomPointPicking.html"">Random Point Picking</a>. Hope this is a good start for you! Once you have a set of vectors that are maximized a part, you can save them in a hash table or something for later, and just perform random rotations on them to get all the colors you desire that are maximally apart from each other!</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Thinking about this problem more, it would be better to map the colors in a linear manor, possibly (0,0,0) --> (255,255,255) lexicographically, and then distribute them evenly. I really don't know how well this will work, but it should since, lets say:</p>

<p>n = 10
we know we have 16777216 colors (256^3). We can use <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/561/using-combinations-of-sets-as-test-data#794"">buckles algorithm 515</a> to find the lexicographically indexed color.<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/gEuCs.gif"" alt=""\frac {\binom {256^3} {3}} {n} * i"">. You'll probably have to edit the algorithm to avoid overflow and probably add some minor speed improvements.</p>

<p>The Wizard isn't as slick as SQL Compare or SQL Data Compare but it does the trick. One issue is that the scripts it generates may need some rearranging and/or editing to flow in one shot.</p>

591,111,2008-08-03T00:37:03Z,580,3,"<p>I work the same way Karl does, by keeping all of my SQL scripts for creating and altering tables in a text file that I keep in source control.  In fact, to avoid the problem of having to have a script examine the live database to determine what ALTERs to run, I usually work like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>On the first version, I place everything during testing into one SQL script, and treat all tables as a CREATE.  This means I end up dropping and readding tables a lot during testing, but that's not a big deal early into the project (since I'm usually hacking the data I'm using at that point anyway).</li>
<li>On all subsequent versions, I do two things: I make a new text file to hold the upgrade SQL scripts, that contain just the ALTERs for that version.  And I make the changes to the original, create a fresh database script as well.  This way an upgrade just runs the upgrade script, but if we have to recreate the DB we don't need to run 100 scripts to get there.</li>
<li>Depending on how I'm deploying the DB changes, I'll also usually put a version table in the DB that holds the version of the DB.  Then, rather than make any human decisions about which scripts to run, whatever code I have running the create/upgrade scripts uses the version to determine what to run.</li>
</ul>

<p>The one thing this will not do is help if part of what you're moving from test to production is data, but if you want to manage structure and not pay for a nice, but expensive DB management package, is really not very difficult.  I've also found it's a pretty good way of keeping mental track of your DB.</p>"
597,76,2008-08-03T01:38:02Z,580,1,"<p>I agree that scripting everything is the best way to go and is what I advocate at work.  You should script everything from DB and object creation to populating your lookup tables.</p>

<p>Anything you do in UI only won't translate (especially for changes... not so much for first deployments) and will end up requiring a tools like what Redgate offers.</p>"

<p><strong>HERE BE DRAGONS</strong></p>

<p>Let's say Joe and Jane regularly log onto the computer, then they will each have 'registries'.</p>

<p>You'll then install your app, and the installer will employ giant hacks and disgusting things to set items under HKCU for them.</p>

<p>THEN, bob will come along and log on (he, and 500 other people have accounts in the domain and so can do this). He's never used this computer before, so he has no registry. The first time he logs in, windows creates him one, but he won't have your setting. </p>

<p>Your app then falls over or behaves incorrectly, and bob complains loudly about those crappy products from raynixon incorporated.</p>

<p>The correct answer is to just have some default settings in your app, which can write them to the registry if it doesn't find them. It's general good practice that your app should never depend on the registry, and should create things as needed, for any registry entry, not just HKCU, anyway</p>"

<p>So my solution is going to be to use the User/Machine Hive, and then in the application it checks if the registry entries are in HKCU and if not, copies them from HKLM. I know this probably isn't the most ideal way of doing it, but it has the least amount of changes.</p>"

<p>When the applications restarted (note we didn't need to reboot the machine), they loaded the new <code>mfc42.dll</code>, and all was well. That, coupled with <code>PendingFileOperations</code> to delete the old one the next time the whole system restarted, worked pretty well.</p>

<LI>If you don't know which process has the file locked, you'll need to examine each process's handle list, and query each handle to determine if it identifies the locked file. Doing this in C# will likely require P/Invoke or an intermediary C++/CLI to call the native APIs you'll need.</LI>
<LI>Once you've figured out which process(es) have the file locked, you'll need to safely inject a small native DLL into the process (you can also inject a managed DLL, but this is messier, as you then have to start or attach to the .NET runtime).</LI>

<P>Essentially: the way to unlock a ""locked"" file is to inject a DLL into the offending process's address space and close it yourself. You can do this using native or managed code. No matter what, you're going to need a small amount of native code or at least P/Invoke into the same.</P>

<p><code>ps u</code> will give you the VSZ and RSS, which are the virtual memory size and resident set size.

If you have several copies of a program running, a lot of the memory in the VSZ will be shared between those processes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In ASP.NET 2.0, ViewState is saved by
  a descendant of PageStatePersister
  class. This class is an abstract class
  for saving and loading ViewsState and
  there are two implemented descendants
  of this class in .Net Framework, named
  HiddenFieldPageStatePersister and
  SessionPageStatePersister. By default
  HiddenFieldPageStatePersister is used
  to save/load ViewState information,
  but we can easily get the
  SessionPageStatePersister to work and
  save ViewState in Session object.</p>

<p>Now all of the domains will trigger the vhost for our project.  The final part is to decode the domain name actually used so that you can work out the username in your code, something like (PHP):</p>

<pre><code>list( $username ) = explode( ""."", $_SERVER[ ""HTTP_HOST"" ] );

<p>If you have a Number than can be between 1 and 100, i would definitely put something in the setter that validates that and then maybe throw an exception that is being caught by the code. The reason is simple: If you don't do it in the setter, you have to remember that 1 to 100 limitation every time you set it, which leads to duplicated code or when you forget it, it leads to an invalid state.</p>

<p>Plus, the Visual Studio integration is really neat, something paper just cannot compete with.

<p>Why it is useful in programming? No idea, but i assume it's because you can get rid of some brackets? I am a quite defensive programmer, so my lines can look like this:</p>

<pre><code>result = (((i + 4) - (a + b)) * MAGIC_NUMBER) - ANOTHER_MAGIC_NUMBER;
</code></pre>

<p>with BODMAS you can make this a bit clearer:</p>

<pre><code>result = (i + 4 - (a + b)) * MAGIC_NUMBER - ANOTHER_MAGIC_NUMBER;
</code></pre>

<p>I think i'd still use the first variant - more brackets, but that way i do not have to learn yet another rule and i run into less risk of forgetting it and causing those weird hard to debug errors?</p>

<P>To write full-text queries in Microsoft SQL Server 2005, you must learn how to use the CONTAINS and FREETEXT Transact-SQL predicates, and the CONTAINSTABLE and FREETEXTTABLE rowset-valued functions.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>That means all of the queries written above with the % and _ are not valid full text queries.</P>
<P>Here is a sample of what a query looks like when calling the CONTAINSTABLE function.</P>

<P>SELECT RANK , * FROM TableName , CONTAINSTABLE (TableName, <EM>, ' ""</EM>WildCard"" ') searchTable WHERE [KEY] = TableName.pk ORDER BY searchTable.RANK DESC</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In order for the CONTAINSTABLE function to know that I'm using a wildcard search, I have to wrap it in double quotes. I can use the wildcard character * at the beginning or ending. There are a lot of other things you can do when you're building the search string for the CONTAINSTABLE function. You can search for a word near another word, search for inflectional words (drive = drives, drove, driving, and driven), and search for synonym of another word (metal can have synonyms such as aluminum and steel).</P>
<P>I just created a table, put a full text index on the table and did a couple of test searches and didn't have a problem, so wildcard searching works as intended.</P>
<P>[Update]</P>
<P>I see that you've updated your question and know that you need to use one of the functions.</P>
<P>You can still search with the wildcard at the beginning, but if the word is not a full word following the wildcard, you have to add another wildcard at the end.</P>Example:  ""*ildcar"" will look for a single word as long as it ends with ""ildcar"".<BR><BR>Example:  ""*ildcar*"" will look for a single word with ""ildcar"" in the middle, which means it will match ""wildcard"".  [Just noticed that Markdown removed the wildcard characters from the beginning and ending of my quoted string here.]<BR>
<P>[Update #2]</P>
<P>Dave Ward - Using a wildcard with one of the functions shouldn't be a huge perf hit. If I created a search string with just ""*"", it will not return all rows, in my test case, it returned 0 records.</P>"
